# Closing Entries
When one [[Fiscal Period]] ends and a new one begins, the revenue, expense, and drawings should show zero balances so that in the new [[Fiscal Period]], these accounts only contain data pertaining to that period.

## Purpose of Closing Entries
It reduces the revenue, expense, and drawings accounts to zero so that they are ready for the next fiscal period.
Closing entries update the owner's equity account in the [[general ledger]].

When we close the books we update the capital account in the ledger based on the net income/loss and/or drawings for that period of time. By doing this we bring the capital ledger account into agreement with the amount indicated on the balance sheet.

## Income Summary
The account in which the balance of the Revenue and expense accounts are transferred to
**It is the Net Income/Loss**

> [!ERROR] Make a Quick T-Account
>  The account balance in the income summary account is not the net income/loss for the [[Fiscal Period]] and it will affect the closing entry


## Close the Drawings account into the Capital Account
This entry decreases the capital account and while at the same time reduces the drawings account to zero
