# Gravity ($\vec{F_g}$)
The "[[Forces|Force]]" that causes all objects to [[Acceleration|Accelerate]] towards the Earth's surface
The rate of gravity does not depend on Mass. Objects of the same Mass fall at the same [[Speed]] in a vacuum. It known as an **Action at a distance force**
$$\vec{F}_{g} = m\vec{g}$$
___
The negative indicates [[Acceleration|deceleration]]
The [[Acceleration]] always stays the same, [[Velocity]] increases or decreases depending on the direction

## Free Fall
[[Acceleration]] that occurs when there is no [[Air Resistance]] or other [[Forces]] affecting the [[Motion]] besides gravity
<!--ID: 1718370433083-->


## Terminal Velocity
When the [[Air Resistance]] on a parachute is equal to the [[Forces|force]] due to gravity acting on the parachute. It will stope [[Acceleration]] and stay at a a constant [[Velocity]]

## Gravitational Field
The region of influence of gravitational force due to an object.
A **field** is an influence on a suitable object over a region of space, whether it is an attraction or repulsion

## Mass vs Weight

| The quantity of matter in an object                                | A measure of the force of gravity acting on an object                       |
| Can change mass only by adding or removing matter                  | It depends on the location and the magnitude of Earth's gravitational field |

# Gravity Constant Near Earth
$$ \vec{g} = -9.8 m/s^2 $$

## Gravitational Field Strength
It is the gravitational force per unit mass. It decreases as an object is moved farther away from earth's surface.
___
*For the Earth's surface*, it is 9.8 N/kg [down]
*On Mount Everest*, it is 9.7647 N/kg [down]
___
The earth bulges at the equator.
*At the North Pole*, it is 9.8322 N/kg [down]
*At the equator* it is 9.7805 N/kg [down]

## When does the Normal Force = Gravity?
The normal force is only equal to gravity when the degree of rotation is 0
If the object is on a ramp of some kind, then the normal force does not equal gravity.
