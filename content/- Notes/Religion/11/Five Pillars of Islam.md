## Shahadah (Creed)
It is a **creed** "There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah". The underlying belief of Islam is that there is only one God.
To be considered a Muslim, you have to say the Shahadah out loud Infront of 2 witnesses

## Sawm (Fasting)
Ritual fasting takes place during [[Islamic Festivals|Ramadan]]. The month commemorates the time when **Muhammad first received the divine message of Allah**. Muslims have to abstain from food, water, evil thoughts, drinking, smoking, and sex during daylight hours. Only some are excused. At the end of each day, they can have a light meal.
**At the end of Ramadan, there is the Feast of** [[Islamic Festivals|Eid al-Fitr]].

## Hajj (Pilgrimage)
Muslims have to complete the pilgrimage (Go to Mecca) once in a lifetime. Only those who can go without causing hardship to dependents and whose health allows them to go. The heart of [[Mecca]] is the [[Kaaba]]. They circle the [[Kaaba]] 7 times.

### Men's Clothing
Two seamless garments made from white cloth.
### Women's Clothing
