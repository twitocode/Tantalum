## Abraham (Islam)
He and his wife, Sarah, were upset that people worshipped idols and not God. They moved to Egypt. He married Hagar and had his son Ishmael.  Abraham sent his wife and son to a dry place called Bakka. **Ishmael cried and water sprang up and the place was called **[[Mecca]]. **Allah told Abraham to rebuild the **[[Kaaba]] where they had to pray for wisdom. Allah answers their prayers for wisdom by sending Muhammad several thousands of years later into the world.
