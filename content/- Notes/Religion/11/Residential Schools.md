# Residential Schools
They were created in 1883 to help provide education to indigenous peoples. The government's goal however, was to assimilate young indigenous children. They wanted them to learn culture and language of Europeans to fit into society better. Most were operated by churches. Children were forbidden to wear traditional clothing or practice cultural practices.
