# Indigenous Ceremonies

## Smudging
Sacred herbs are burned in a shell or earthen bowl, and the smoke is brushed over the participants

It is used as a cleansing smoke to purify people and places, such as before a wedding or [[Indigenous Rituals|Powwow]]. Ashes are also holy.

## Sacred Pipe Ceremony
The pipe symbolizes unity and harmony of the world.
- The bowl of the pipe represents truth, and the stem represents the way to live in harmony and balance with all of creation.
- When lit, all the pipe contains is delivered over to the fire which is the [[Sacred Indigenous People|Great Spirit]]
- Smoking the pipe stresses the unity of everything.
