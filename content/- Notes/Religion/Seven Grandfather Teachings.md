# Seven Grandfather Teachings
The Seven Grandfather Teachings are a set of Anishinaabe guiding principles that give people the tools for how to live a good life
## History
There were Seven Grandfathers who were given the responsibility by the Creator to watch over the Earth’s people.
• They saw that life was not good, so they sent a helper, the Oshkabaywis, to walk among the people and bring them someone who could be taught how to live in harmony with Creation.
• It took seven tries but eventually the Oshkabaywis brought them a baby and they were happy.
• They instructed the Oshkabaywis to take the baby to every corner of the earth to see all of Creation.
• This took seven years and when they returned, each of the Grandfathers gave the child a gift – a teaching – to share with all the Earth’s people.

## Love
It is to know peace, its unconditional and must be given freely. Love is represented by the **eagle**, who can travel over great distances and carry it and all of the teachings to the four directions the Earth
## Respect
To honour all of creation. Its mutual and reciprocal. The **bison/buffalo** was at one time a significant resource for Anishinaabe people, giving every part of itself to sustain human life for food, clothing and shelter.
## Truth
To know all and live them. Speaking only what you've lived or experienced. Truth is represented by the **turtle**, who was here during the Creation of Earth and carries all of life’s teachings on his back.
## Wisdom
To Cherish Knowledge, use it for the good of all. Wisdom is represented by the **beaver**, who uses its natural gifts of sharp teeth wisely to cut logs and branches to build dams
## Courage
To face your foes with integrity and do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant. The **mother bear** has the courage and strength to face her fears and challenges while protecting her young.
## Honesty
To be sincere when facing a situation. Be honest first with yourself. Honesty is represented by the **Sabe or sometimes the raven**. The Sabe and raven accepts themselves for who they are and does not look to try to be like others.
## Humility
To know oneself as a sacred part of the creation. Humility is represented by the **wolf**, who are social animals that live in packs. They work in cooperation with each other and for the greater good of the pack.
