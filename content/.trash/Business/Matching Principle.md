# Matching Principle
A [[GAAP]] that states that the [[Expenses]] of one [[Fiscal Period]] should only be compared with the [[Revenue]] of the same fiscal period
### Example
We cannot use revenue from July & August to make the Net income or loss look better for August. We can only use August's revenue
