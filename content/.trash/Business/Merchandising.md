## Net Income for a Merchandising Company

### Profit Formula
$$\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$$
<!--ID: 1717108747972-->


### Net Income/Loss Formula
$$\text{Net Income/Loss} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Expenses}$$
- Income occurs when the $\text{Revenue} > \text{Expenses} + \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$
- Loss occurs when the $\text{Revenue} < \text{Expenses} + \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$

### Why is Cost of Goods sold included in the income statement?

## Schedule of Cost of Goods Sold

$$\text{Net Purchases} = \text{Purchases} - \text{Purchase Returns and Allowances} - \text{Purchase Discounts}$$
