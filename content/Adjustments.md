<!--ID: 1715172756251-->


## Prepaid Expenses #flashcard 
Expenses that have been paid in advance. e.g. Rent, Insurance
They have value until they are used it up, once prepaid expenses have been used up; they become [[Expenses]]
Prepaid Rent -> Rent Expense
**TLDR, Money you set aside for bills**
<!--ID: 1715172756257-->


## Supplies
Must be adjusted because over the [[Fiscal Period]] some supplies are used up.
Supplies -> Supplies Expense

<!--ID: 1715172756259-->


## Accounts
Depreciation Expense - Equipment 
Accumulated Depreciation - Equipment

Accumulated Depreciation #flashcard 
A **contra asset**, it reduces the original value of a fixed asset and is recorded on the balance sheet.
<!--ID: 1715172756261-->


## Methods
### Straight-Line Method #flashcard 
Either the original cost of the asset is multiplied by the depreciation rate for the fiscal period to determine the amount of the adjustment. Or this formula is used
**$$\text{Annual depreciation for the Asset} = \frac{\text{Original cost of Asset} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Estimated useful life of the asset}}$$ This method produces depreciation figures that are the same each year.**

#### Salvage Value #flashcard 
The value of a product after it has been fully depreciated.
<!--ID: 1715177176384-->


### Declining Balance method #flashcard 
Fixed Assets are depreciated by an equal percentage per fiscal period based on the asset's **Book Value**. 
Take the original cost of the asset and subtract anything in the accumulated depreciation account and then multiply by the depreciation rate.

> [!ERROR] Salvage value is not taken into consideration

#### Book Value #flashcard 
$$ \text{The original cost of the asset} - \text{Its accumulated depreciation}$$
<!--ID: 1715096750921-->


This method produces depreciation figures that are larger in the early years and smaller in the later years.

## What method does the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency use? #flashcard
