**Bond Dissociation Energy**: the quantity of energy required to break a chemical bond. Measured in $kJ/mol$

> [!Info]
> They are **measured in averages** because the bond energy of a bond is affected by the number of atoms and bonds around it. Using an an average is more convient

### Trends in Bond Energies
1. Multiple bonds are generally stronger than single bonds
2. As the number of bonds increases, the bond length shortens

# What happens in a reaction?
1. The bonds in the reactants break first. For bonds to be broken, energy must be added (endothermic). 
2. Then new bonds are made in the products which releases energy (exothermic)

$\Delta H=$ 
	sum of energies required to break old bonds **-** 
	sum of energies released in the formation of new bonds

energy required is the reactants bond energies and energy released is the products bond energies
$n$ is the amount in moles of each reactant or product

> $\Delta H = (n_{\ce{H-H}} D_{\ce{H-H}} + n_{\ce{F-F}} D_{\ce{F-F}}) - n_{\ce{H-F}} D_{\ce{H-F}}$
> $= (1 \, \text{mol} \times D_{\ce{H-H}} + 1 \, \text{mol} \times D_{\ce{F-F}}) - 2 \, \text{mol} \times D_{\ce{H-F}}$
> $= \left[ \left( 1 \, \text{mol} \times \frac{432 \, \text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} \right) + \left( 1 \, \text{mol} \times \frac{154 \, \text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} \right) \right] - \left( 2 \, \text{mol} \times \frac{565 \, \text{kJ}}{\text{mol}} \right)$
