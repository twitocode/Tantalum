| Exposition                       | "A hundred and fifty years before, when the parochial disagreements between Earth and Mars had been on the verge of war, the Belt had been a far horizon of tremendous mineral wealth beyond viable economic reach, and the outer planets had been beyond even the most unrealistic corporate dream. Then Solomon Epstein had built his little modified fusion drive" (Corey 7). | This passage goes over general information about the book. There are three major factions, Earth and Mars (inners), and the Belt (Asteroid Belt). There are constant tensions between Earth and Mars. A magical piece of technology allowed humans to venture out into the Belt to control the entire system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Character                        | "'People look at you, they don’t see Dmitri Havelock, good cop. They see Earth.' . . . ‘Look, I’m sure there are all kinds of differences . . . I’m just saying anyone this far out from the sun? They don’t care. From this distance, you can cover Earth and Mars with one thumb'" (Corey 42).                                                                                 | Detective Miller is talking to Havelock is working at Ceres station which home to the majority of belters. Inners took all the mineral wealth in the belt and oppress the people. Havelock happens to be an inner, so when he works on Ceres, nobody views him as an equal. It does not matter how much better he is than other cops. He is facing prejudice that, in this case, is justified. In the asteroid belt, there is no difference between Earth and Mars, they just see the enemy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rising Action                    | "The Canterbury shuddered and the monitor went white . . . 'My God. They nuked her. They nuked the Cant,'  . . . That can’t be right, Holden’s mind protested. That doesn’t happen. Pirates don’t nuke water haulers. No one wins. No one gets paid" (Corey 54).                                                                                                                 | There is a mysterious faction which are not pirates, someone is trying to start a war. We still do not know who but what we do know is that the Canterbury was the tipping point for the people of the asterioid belt to rise up again their inner rulers. **ADD MORE**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Conflict<br>Character vs Society | “‘You know what Mars wants? They want you, doing this. They want this piece of s--- here to make sure that everyone looks at Belters and thinks we’re a bunch of psychopaths who tear up their own station. They want to tell themselves we’re just like them. Well, we aren’t. We’re Belters, and we take care of our own’” (Corey 68-69).                                      | This event occurred after the destruction of the ice hauler Canterbury. There are riots in streets demanding to fight against Mars after they were falsely accused of the Canterbury's destruction. Miller is a belter who is apart of Earth-owned station security. A belter just killed an innocent Earther. One of the steps of keeping control of a people is to keep them divided among each other. The asteroid belt has multiple factions that do not like each other. Miller is able to realize that the inners are using this fact to keep the people looking like psychopaths instead of a civilized nation. *Miller also has an internal conflict of working for and Earth security firm that is establishing order in a belter station, while being a belter himself.* |
| Dialogue                         | "'. . . it’s the XO’s job to tell the captain when he’s being an idiot. You’re being an idiot, sir. You already tried to goad them into killing us with that broadcast. Now you want to chase them? . . . 'You are going to get the remaining four members of your crew to safety. And that’s all. When we’re safe, you can go on your crusade. Sir'" (Corey 57).                | Naomi is the XO (Executive Officer) meaning the second in command. She is speaking to James Holden who is the ship captain. The home ship, the Canterbury, was just nuked with 50 souls on board. Holden's team was on a search and rescue but got tricked. He blames himself for all of the deaths on board and cannot stop grieving about it. He also broadcasted system-wide that Mars was the perpetrator. Naomi is the voice of reason. She knows that they are currently drifting through space. She is the part of Holden's brain that takes action. She is able to look at the consequences of actions 10 steps ahead.  **May be add more**                                                                                                                                |
| Theme - Oppression               | "'You think so? The inner planets look on us as their labor force. They tax us. They direct what we do. They enforce their laws and ignore ours in the name of stability. In the last year, . . . They’ve blocked any Belter freighters from taking Europa contracts. They charge us twice as much to dock at Ganymede'” (Corey 108).                                            | Belters live in the asteroid belt, Mars and Earth need the resources of the belt. They keep the people under control by controlling everything inside Ceres station. Whether it be through starvation. **REWORD THIS**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Imagery             | "A dozen needles stuck into his back through membranes in his suit. His heart shuddered and chemical bands of iron gripped his brain. His spine went dead cold, and his face flushed like a radiation burn" (Corey 51).                                                                                                  | The spaceship Canterbury is currently being attacked by 6 smaller ships. Holden and his crew are in a very small spaceship trying to rush to the Canterbury. In this setting, there is no magical technology that can erase physics. Going at speeds of 40k km/h will kill a human without the drugs that they have to take. You can feel the sensation of have a dozen needles in your back and feeling a cold liquid flow through your body. It is an unpleasant, but necessary feeling. Holden and Alex's body felt very heavy because of the acceleration. Structural integrity of the ship would decrease because of the high speed, hence the creaking and groaning. **Go over this again** |
| Similie             | "Holden froze, watching the blood pump from Shed’s neck, then whip away like smoke into an exhaust fan” (Corey 134).                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The characters in this scene are currently inside of a spaceship that is in active combat. Shed was just killed from a large bullet from an outside ship that penetrated the hull. Blood escaped the room they were in through the hole that was blown through by the bullet. The blood is acting like smoke just as smoke would have only one way to get out of a room; through a vent. *The room was being "vented". Space is cold, ice cubes in Holden's ears are analogous to the empty cold they were being exposed to.*                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Metaphor            | ”EarthLily, which had always made him think of the waste recycling levels . . . Recycled air that had passed through a million lungs. Water from the tap so clean it could be used for lab work, but it had been piss and s--- and tears and blood and would be again” (Corey 25).                                       | The EarthLily flower is a flower that is a metaphor to the waste recycling system on Ceres. The flower takes in the polluted air and water, and turns it into clean air and water. However, the flower would be a perfect version of Ceres. Most of the air and water on ceres is not clean because they cannot afford to make it clean. To the people on Ceres, the circle of life is just the recycling system. **Explain this a bit more**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Situational Irony   | “‘To further investigate this matter, and to aid in discovering the true wrongdoers, if any, the MCRN is dispatching one of their ships from the Jupiter system to pick you up . . . You will assist the MCRN in their investigation into the destruction of the Canterbury’” (Corey 75).                                | Our main characters were on a search and rescue mission when they witness their spaceship being supposedly destroyed by the Martian Congressional Republic Navy (MCRN). They blamed the deaths of the 50 people on board on Mars. Their current ship is low on supplies, Mars ends up being the one who saves them from dying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This prologue tried to explain how she went missing. Throughout the pages, it talks about why the ship that Julie is in, the Scopuli, was abandoned. This all led up to the discovery of a mysterious bio-organism that is feeding off the nuclear energy of the Scoupli's drive core. These pages keep the reader guessing that Julie would encounter next.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Setting             | "Miller looked at her—dark eyes, pale hair, smooth skin. She was already too tall to be mistaken for an Earth child, her limbs longer and thinner. Her skin had the pink flush of Belter babies, which came with the pharmaceutical cocktail that assured that their muscles and bones would grow strong" (Corey 38-39). | There are different settings in the book. Ceres was never meant to be a natural environment for humans. The near lack of gravity makes it so that our bodies develop differently. Bones are not as hard and are more stretched out; hence the taller appearance and cocktail. This appearance makes outsiders view them as "sub-human"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
