# Narrative Elements:
Select specific passages that showcase narrative techniques such as parts of a story (exposition, conflict, climax) point of view, characters, dialogue or theme. Discuss their significance in shaping the story.

*Extra*: multiple characters in the story are looking for Julie. It is kinda like a murder mystery
