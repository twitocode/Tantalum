# Forces
## What are they?
1. Push or Pull
2. Cause objects to speed up, slow down, change direction, or stay still
3. Compress, stretch, or twist matter
4. A Vector Quantity
## Measuring Forces
The unit of force is the newton ($N$)
$1N$ = $kg * m/s^2$

## Everyday forces

### Applied Forces $\vec{F}_{A}$ #flashcard 
One object is in contact with another object and either pushes or pulls

### [[Tension]] Force $\vec{F}_{T}$ #flashcard 
A pulling force exerted on an object by a rope or string.

### Normal Force $\vec{F}_{N}$ #flashcard 
A contact force that surfaces exert to prevent solid objects from passing through each other.

### Force of [[Friction]] $\vec{F}_{f}$ #flashcard 
A force that resists the motion or attempted motion of an object

### Force of [[Gravity]] $\vec{F}_{g}$
The force of attraction that exists between any two objects due to their [[Gravity|mass]].
It always points towards the center of the earth.

##  Magnitude of the force of [[gravity]] on an object
$$\vec{F}_{g} = m\vec{g}$$
$\vec{F}_{g}$ is the force of [[gravity]] in newtons ($N$), 
$m$ is the [[Gravity|mass]] in $kg$. 
$\vec{g}$ is the gravity constant ($9.8N/kg$ [Down])
## Free Body Diagrams (FBD)
A simple drawing representing the object being analyzed and all the forces acting on it.
**NOT THE FORCES IT EXERTS ON OTHER OBJECTS.**

## Calculating Net Forces
Net Force ($\vec{F}_{net}$) is the combined forces of a single object.
Horizontal and vertical forces are calculated seperately
## The Four Fundamental Forces

### Strong Force #flashcard 
This force holds the nucleus of an atom together
![[Pasted image 20240325100138.png]]
<!--ID: 1718370433185-->


Range - Particles must be within the width of the nucleus ($\approx 10^{-15}$m)
Relative strength - 1

### Electromagnetic Force #flashcard 
This force holds atoms and molecules together. It also causes atoms and molecules to repel is they get too close
![[Pasted image 20240325100135.png]]
<!--ID: 1718370433189-->


Range - Infinite
Relative Strength - 1/137

### Weak Nuclear Force #flashcard 
This force is responsible for some kinds of radioactive decay
![[Pasted image 20240325100130.png]]
<!--ID: 1718370433193-->


Range - $\approx 10^{-18}$m
Relative Strength - $10^{-5}$

### [[Gravity]]
Attracts objects due to their mass

Range - Infinite
Relative Strength - $6\cdot 10^{-39}$
