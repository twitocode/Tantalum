If the overall equation for a reaction can be expressed as the algebraic sum of the equations of two or more other reactions, then the $\Delta H$ of that reaction is the algebraic sum of the $\Delta H$ for those reactions

> [!Example]
> Nitrogen Dioxide can be created in one step
> ![[Pasted image 20241207122254.png]]
> Or in two steps
> ![[Pasted image 20241207122309.png]]
> If  you add the two equations
> ![[Pasted image 20241207122351.png]]
> Then you'll get the one step equation at the top

> [!ERROR] Rules of Enthalpy Changes
> If you reverse a chemical reaction, you must also reverse the sign for $\Delta H$
> If the moles of every reactant and product is multiplied, then $\Delta H$ is multiplied by that same number
