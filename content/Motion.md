# Motion #flashcard 
A change in the location of an object, as measured by and observer
<!--ID: 1718370433056-->


## Graphs

### Position Time #flashcard 
![[Pasted image 20240326130445.png]]
Constant [[velocity]], where slope is equal to the [[velocity]]
![[Pasted image 20240326130502.png]]
Exponential, [[velocity]] is not constant, meaning it is [[Acceleration|accelerating]].
<!--ID: 1718370433058-->


### Velocity Time #flashcard 
![[Pasted image 20240326130608.png]]
Constant [[Acceleration]]. Slope is equal to the [[Acceleration]]. The area under the graph during the time interval is [[Displacement]]

### Acceleration Time #flashcard 
![[Pasted image 20240326130717.png]]
Area under the graph during the time interval is [[Velocity]]

## Motion in two Directions
![[Pasted image 20240326131303.png]]
[E 20° N] is the same thing as [N 70° E], the former is preferred.

### Steps
1. Find component vectors and take the sum of them
2. Find [[Distance]] using Pythagorean's Theorem
3. Find angle using SOH CAH TOA

### Formulas for Motion in 2 directions #flashcard 
$$ \Delta \vec{d}_{x} = \Delta \vec{d} \cos \theta$$
$$ \Delta \vec{d}_{y} = \Delta \vec{d} \sin \theta$$

## Projectiles #flashcard 
Any object that moves in response to [[Gravity]] along a two-dimensional curved trajectory
___
### Key Details
- Horizontal and vertical motion are **independent**.
- Horizontal motion ($\vec{V}_{av}$) is **constant**. Meaning there is no [[Acceleration]]. 
- Vertical Motion ($\vec{V}_{i}$, $\vec{V}_{f}$) is not constant. There is [[Acceleration]] due to gravity.

### When Problem-Solving

| Horizontal Motion (x) | Vertical Motion (y)   |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| $\vec{V}_{av}$        | $\vec{a} = -9.8m/s^2$ |
|                       | $\vec{V}_{i} = ?$     |
|                       | $\vec{V}_{f} = ?$     |
|                       | $\Delta t = ?$        |
$\Delta t$ is the same for both horizontal and vertical motion
