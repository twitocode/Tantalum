the mathematical description of a chemical system at equilibrium 
$$K_{eq} = \frac{[\text{products}]}{\text{[reactants]}}$$

Example: $\ce{2A(g) + B(g) <=> 3C(s) + D(g)}$
$$K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^3[D]}{[A]^2[B]}$$
- The coefficients from the balanced chemical equation become the exponents of the concentrations in the equilibrium law.

## Using it in practice
The following equilibrium concentrations were obtained at 490 degrees
$$
\begin{align*}
[\ce{H2}] &= 8.62 \times 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{mol/L} \\
[\ce{I2}] &= 2.63 \times 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{mol/L} \\
[\ce{HI}] &= 1.02 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}
$$

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Only equilibrium concentrations can be substituted into equilibrium law

$$K_{eq} = \frac{[\ce{HI}]^2}{[\ce{H2}][\ce{I2}]}$$
$$= \frac{(1.02 \ \mathrm{mol/L})^2}{(8.62 \times 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{mol/L})(2.63 \times 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{mol/L})}$$

$$=45.9$$
$K_{eq} = 45.9$ which means that there is 45.9x more product than reactant *at this temperature*.
The value of $K_{eq}$ changes depending on the temperature, but is constant when changing concentrations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this example, there is no unit because the mol/L cancel out. BUT there will never be one unit for the equilibrium constant.

Since
$$K_{eq} = \frac{[\ce{HI}]^2}{[\ce{H2}][\ce{I2}]}$$
Then
$$
\begin{align*}
45.9 &= \frac{(2n)^2}{(1.00-n)(1.00-n)} \\
45.9 &= \frac{(2n)^2}{(1.00-n)^2} \\
\sqrt{45.9} &= \frac{2n}{1.00-n} \\
6.77(1.00 - n) &= 2n \\
6.77 - 6.77n &= 2n \\
6.77 &= 8.77n \\
0.77 &= n
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore
$$
\begin{align*}
[\ce{H2_{(g)}}] &= [\ce{I2_{(g)}}] = 1.00 - 0.77 \\
&= 0.23 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{align*}
[\ce{HI_{(g)}}] &= 2(0.77) \\
&= 1.54 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}
$$

## Significance of different $K_{eq}$ values
$$\ce{A + B <=> C + D}$$ $$K_{eq} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$$If $K_{eq}$​ is very large, **the equilibrium must lie far to the right since product concentrations must be greater than reactant concentrations** for the numerator to be greater than the denominator in the equilibrium law.

If $K_{eq}​$ is very small, **the equilibrium must lie far to the left since reactant concentrations must be greater than the product concentrations** for the denominator to be greater than the numerator in the equilibrium law.

When $K_{eq}$​ = 1, **the equilibrium does not lie in any particular direction** because the reactant concentrations must be very close to the product concentrations.

# Temperature Effects of the Equilibrium Constant

1. For the reaction $\ce{\text{heat} + A <=> B + C}$
   **Increasing the temperature causes the equilibrium to shift to the right as predicted by Le Chatelier's Principle**. This increases the concentration of the products $B + C$. Therefore for endothermic reactions, $K_{eq}$ increases as temperature increases and decreases if temperature decreases
2. For the reaction $\ce{A + B <=> C + \text{heat}}$
   **Increasing the temperature causes the equilibrium to shift to the left**. This increases the concentration for the reactant $A$. Therefore, for exothermic reactions, $K_{eq}$ increases as the temperature decreases and decreases if the temperature increases. 


| Type of Reaction | Temperature Change | $K_{eq}$ change |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| endothermic      | increases          | increases       |
| endothermic      | decreases          | decreases       |
| exothermic       | increases          | decreases       |
| exothermic       | decreases          | increases       |

# Solids and Liquids in equilibrium?
**Heterogenous Systems**: one which involves a reaction between 2 or states of matter.
**Homogenous Systems**: a reaction where all participants are present in the same state.

$$\ce{CaCO_{3(g)} <=> CaO_{(s)} + CO_{2(g)}} $$
$$K_{eq} = \frac{[CaO_{(s)}][CO_{2(g)}]}{[CaCO_{3(s)}]}$$

![[Pasted image 20250103171929.png]]
$$
\begin{align*}
K_{eq} &= \frac{\text{constant}[CO_{2(g)}]}{\text{constant}} \\
K_{eq} \times \frac{\text{constant}}{\text{constant}} &= [CO_{2(g)}] \\
K_{eq}' &= [CO_{2(g)}]
\end{align*}
$$

**The concentration of pure solids or pure liquids cannot change.**
