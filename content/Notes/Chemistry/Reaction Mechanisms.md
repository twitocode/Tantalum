Reactions proceed by a series of simple steps called **elementary processes** involving 1 or 2 particles at a time. 
A series of *elementary processes* is a **reaction mechanism**

The slowest step (*elementary process*) is the **rate determining step** for the overall reaction

> [!Example] 
> Making Pizza
> Make Dough -> Put Toppings -> Bake Pizza -> Cut Pizza
> ---
> Baking the pizza is the longest Step (*rate determining step*)

**Reaction Intermediate**: part of the reaction but not part of the overall equation. In this case its $\ce{N_{2}O_{2}}$
