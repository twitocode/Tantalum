*ONE THING THAT I NOTICE DURING READING IS THAT THE CHAPTERS ALTERNATE BETWEEN HOLDEN AND MILLER. THE HOLDEN CHAPTERS ARE ON THE POINT OF VIEW OF HOLDEN AND HIS CREW. THE MILLER CHAPTERS ARE ALL ON HIS POINT OF VIEW, DURING THE CROSSROADS ON PAGE 238, IT WAS VERY CLEAR*
**You need to include eight entries in your reading journal. Your entries will be based on specific incidents** 
**in your novel as well as interpretations of your novel as a whole. The eight entries are outlined below.** 
1. **Create a reading schedule.** 
	Read chapters everyday at lunch and if possible during class time
2. **A short written reflection about why you chose your novel.** 
   The reason why I chose this novel is because I have seen the show adaptation three times. The show is called The Expanse and it is currently my favourite show of all time. I wanted to see the differences between the two mediums. As to why I liked the show, I love sci-fi shows and movies; it is my favourite genre. What is different about The Expanse is that the show takes place in approximately 200 years from now. Humanity has colonized the solar system but it not like star trek where there is no realism. This show is for the most part, physically accurate, and has realistic conflicts that are similar in ones in our history. 
3. **Notes about character development in two parts.** 
	*What have you learned about the main character(s) from the first half of the novel?*
	- Detective Miller
		- **VERY IMPORTANT: THE TWO TYPES OF MILLER ON PAGE 294**
		- **Inner conflict** Detective** Miller lived on Ceres as a police officer. He is a belter; a person who was born in the asteroid belt. Earth currently ‘owns’ Ceres and established Star Helix to enforce security; Miller works for them. Every belter hates Earth and Mars because they own them with an iron grip. He struggles with the internal conflict of working with the government that are actively oppressing his own people **ADD MORE**. 
		- **Detective** He is able to see through cracks in the mystery of the Canterbury’s and Donnager’s destruction that others are unable to see. His stubbornness gets the better of him. Miller as always trying to find the next clue to the case. Miller is a really good detective, found James Holden in a large solar system while Holden was doing his best to stay hidden.
		- **Julie** Miller was assigned to a case of a missing rich girl. He is very fascinated by her because she went from living well off on Earth to living in the slums of the Belt. He now sees her as hallucinations. He wants a comfort person as he is always lonely or with his detective partner. His wife left him years ago. Naomi says to Holden, “No, they were friends or something. He’s having trouble dealing with it, so maybe don’t push him too hard.” (p.249). “‘Julie was a good kid,‘ Miller said as if he were confessing something. ‘She flew a mean racing ship. I just… I wanted to get her back alive” (p.253) “*What am i looking at here, Julie?* he thought. *I’m seeing something here, but I don’t know what it is*” (p.262)
		- Everything was taken away from him, that chapter of his life was over, but he is still able to persevere “The man was right; it should have been painful. Everything he’d ever had was gone. His job, his community. He wasn’t even a cop anymore, his checked-in-luggage handgun notwithstanding . . . He probed himself like a doctor searching for inflammation. Did it hurt here? Did he feel the loss there? He didn’t. There was only a sense of relief so profound it approached giddiness” (p. 226)
		- On his search for Holden and his crew, he takes a wild guess and ventures to Eros to find Holden, “‘I hope I’m right about this,’ he said to Julie. ‘If Holden’s not there, I’m gonna feel pretty stupid.’ In his mind, she smiled ruefully *Life is a risk*, she said” (p.211)
		- He was tasked to look for a girl that caught the attention of those with much more power than him. ““ Miller gets fired but continues to look for her just this time without Star Helix’s resources. He has no idea who she is. Miller wanted more in his life. He was just a regular officer that was really good at his job. He is seen as boring to others.
		- Miller is the type of guy you want to **depend on** when you are in a sticky situation. He will do anything to survive. “Holden turned the guard around to face the door and pulled the handgun out of the man’s belt holster. He hoped all Miller’s threats were just threats. He suspected they weren’t” (p.273). “The citizens hesitated, then ran. Miller took a few cartridges out of his pocket and began replacing the three he’d fired. Holden started to speak, but Miller cut him off. ‘Take the throat shot if you can. Most people, the faceplate and chest armor don’t quite cover that gap. If the neck is covered, then shoot the inside of the thigh. Very thin armor there. Mobility issue. Takes most people down in one shot.’” (p.276)
		- Miller is not afraid of killing . “Killing another human being was hard. Some people couldn’t. The perp’s gun came around; the gunman dropped the woman and shouted. It turned out that, for Miller at least, it wasn’t all that hard. Afterward, he’d been through mandatory counseling. He’d cried. He’d suffered the nightmares and the shakes and all the things that cops suffered quietly and didn’t talk about. But even then, it seemed to be happening at a distance, like he’d gotten too drunk and was watching himself throw up. It was just a physical reaction. It would pass. The important thing was he knew the answer to the question. Yes, if he needed to, he could take a life.” (p.278)
		- “It wasn’t until now, walking through the corridors of Eros, that he’d taken joy in it. Even taking down the poor bastard in that first firefight had felt like the sad necessity of work. Pleasure in killing hadn’t come until after Julie, and it wasn’t really pleasure as much as a brief cessation of pain” (p.278)
		- “He wanted to think it had been finding Julie, seeing what had happened to her body, knowing he hadn’t been able to save her, but that was only because it seemed like the sentimental moment. The truth was his decisions before then—leaving Ceres to go on a wild hunt for Julie, drinking himself out of a career, remaining a cop for even a day after that first kill all those years earlier—none of them seemed to make sense, viewed objectively. He’d lost a marriage to a woman he’d loved once. He’d lived hip deep in the worst humanity had to offer. He’d learned firsthand that he was capable of killing another human being. And nowhere along the line could he say that there, at that moment, he had been a sane, whole man, and that afterward, he hadn’t.” (p.285)
		- In his mind, Julie Mao tilted her head, listening to his thoughts. In his mind, she held him, her body against his in a way that was more comforting than erotic. Consoling. Forgiving. This was why he had searched for her. Julie had become the part of him that was capable of human feeling. The symbol of what he could have been if he hadn’t been this. There was no reason to think his imagined Julie had anything in common with the real woman. Meeting her would have been a disappointment for them both. He had to believe that, the same way he’d had to believe everything that had cut him off from love before. (p.285)
	
	- James Holden
		- Holden is character that cares very deeply about his crewmates. He is willing to do anything to get them back, but he acts irrationally. He needs that voice of reason, which is his executive officer Naomi. After the destruction of the Canterbury, he has become more independent and fends off anyone who tries to hurt his ‘family’. Before he was just the executive officer of the Canterbury, and he was cheerful and a playboy. Holden is now the captain of his remaining crew. Holden felt the need to become stronger. **ADD MORE**. He does not the fit the stereotype of a strong man, yes he served in the military, but he does not know basic combat training when it comes down to actually fighting for his crew.
		- Fighting for his crewmates, “This message is to whoever ordered the destruction of the Canterbury, the civilian ice freighter that you just blew into gas. You don’t get to just fly away, you murderous son of a bitch. I don’t care what your reasons are, but you just killed fifty friends of mine. You need to know who they were. I am sending to you the name and photograph of everyone who just died in that ship. Take a good look at what you did. Think about that while I work on finding out who you are” (p.55) He really wants to avenge them, “but sitting here while the people who killed our ship keep doing whatever it is they're doing is making me nuts” (p.214)
		- **He is a good person**, “He’d done some things in the navy that had kept him awake nights. He’d followed some orders he vehemently disagreed with. But to lock on to a civilian ship with fifty people aboard and press the button that launched six nuclear weapons? He would have refused. If his commanding officer had insisted, he’d have declared it an illegal order and demanded that the executive officer take control of the ship and arrest the captain. They’d have had to shoot him to get him away from the weapon post. He’d known the sort of people who would have followed the order, though. He told himself that they were sociopaths and animals, no better than pirates who’d board your ship, strip your engine, and take your air. That they weren’t human.” (p.74)
		- **Good leader**: “Okay, let me finish,” she said. “I want you to know I think you’ve done a great job of keeping us alive. You keep us focused on the problems we can solve instead of feeling sorry for ourselves. You keep everyone in orbit around you. Not everyone can do that, I couldn’t do it, and we’ve needed that stability.” (p.217)
		- **Afraid of dying???** “No. She had left him. Naomi had said she would, but confronted with the reality of it, Holden realized that he hadn’t really believed her. But here it was—the proof. The empty space where she used to be. His heart hammered and his throat tightened, breath coming in gasps. The sick feeling in his gut was either despair or his colon sloughing off its lining. He was going to die sitting outside a cheap hotel on Eros because Naomi had done exactly what she’d said she would. What he himself had ordered her to do. His resentment refused to listen to reason” (p.287) “The truth was he didn’t want to die. Even during  his time in the navy, the idea of dying in the line of duty had always seemed distant and unreal. His ship would never be destroyed, and if it was, he would make it to the escape shuttle. The universe without him in it didn’t make any sense at all. He’d taken risks; he’d seen other people die. Even people he loved. Now, for the first time, his own death was a real thing.” (p.289)
		- **Wants to save everyone, even those he does not know** “‘He’s dead,’ Miller said as he replaced the cartridge he’d fired. ‘Go to hell. We don’t know. If we can get him to the ship, maybe… ’ Miller shook his head, a sad but distant expression on his face as he looked at the child in Holden’s arms. ‘He took high-caliber round to the center of mass,’ Miller said. ‘He’s gone.’” (p.291)
		- Conflict with miller: “‘He’s innocent in this,’ Holden said, the sight of the injured and infected man making his eyes burn. ‘He’s innocent.’ . . . ‘Trust me,’ Miller said. ‘Dying is the best thing that could happen to that guy today. You’re not doing him any favors.’ ‘You don’t get to decide that,’ Holden replied, his tone edging into real anger.”
	*How have the main character(s) changed, grown, or revealed themselves in the second half?* 
	- Detective Miller
		- Miller has shown himself to be a stubborn person, a very rational being. He is able to realize that the world is not sunshine and rainbows. 
		- **Sentimental** - “He wondered what his old partners would have made of his behavior on Eros. Havelock. Muss. He tried to imagine them in his place. He’d killed people, and he’d done it cold. Eros had been a kill box, and when the people in charge of the law wanted you dead, the law didn’t apply anymore. And some of the dead assholes had been the ones who’d killed Julie.” (p.318) “So. Revenge killing. Was he really down to revenge killing? That was a sad thought. He tried to imagine Julie sitting beside him the way Naomi had with Holden. It was like she’d been waiting for the invitation. Julie Mao, who he’d never really known. She raised a hand in greeting. And what about us? he asked her as he looked into her dark, unreal eyes. Do I love you, or do I just want to love you so bad I can’t tell the difference?” (p.318)
		- **Rational** - “‘You found a Martian battery, right? So you told everyone in the solar system about it and started the single largest war in human history. Only turns out the Martians maybe weren’t the ones that left it there. Then, a bunch of mystery ships kill the Donnager, which Mars blames on the Belt, only, dammit, the Belt didn’t even know it was capable of killing a Martian battle cruiser.’ . . . ‘Let me finish! And now you find some data that implicates Earth. First thing you do is blab it to the universe, so that Mars and the Belt drag Earth into this thing, making the largest war of all time even bigger. Are you seeing a pattern here?’” (p.328)
		- “‘Yeah,’ Miller said, ‘because telling everyone there’s an alien virus that wants to kill them all is a great way to maintain calm and order.’” (p.362)
		- **Self-Sacrifice** - 
		- **Conflict** - “Part of Miller’s mind—the part that was still a cop and not a soldier—twitched at that. They were civilians. Killing them was, at the very least, bad form. But then Julie whispered in the back of his mind, No one here is innocent, and he had to agree.” (p.405)
	- James Holden
		- Holden has shown himself to be an emotional person, one who cannot think 2 steps ahead. He deeply cares about his crew and will not under any circumstances get them hurt.
		- **Irrational & Naive** - “‘You’re telling me that I did this,’ Holden said. ‘That if I hadn’t broadcast that data, those ships would still be alive. Those people.’ ‘That, yeah. And that if the bad guys wanted to keep people from watching Eros, it just worked.’” (p.356)  
		- “Miller said, slowly this time. ‘Twice now you’ve had the choice of whether or not to break the solar system, and both times you’ve screwed it up. I don’t want to see you strike out.’” (p.360)
		- “‘You can’t just throw information at people,’ Miller said. ‘You have to know what it means. What it’s going to do.’” (p.361)
		- “‘People have a right to know what’s going on,’ Holden said. ‘Your argument boils down to you not thinking people are smart enough to figure out the right way to use it.’ ‘Has anyone used anything you’ve broadcast as something besides an excuse to shoot someone they already didn’t like? Giving them a new reason won’t stop them killing each other,’ Miller said” (p.63)
		- **Other** - “The bastard had no right to be comfortable. Condescending. Holden wanted the man terrified, begging for his life, not sneering behind his cultured accent. ‘Amos, if he talks to me again without being told to, break his jaw.’” (p.416)
		- **“Everyone must survive”** “‘You shot him in coldblood!’ ‘Yeah,’ Miller said. Holden shook his head. ‘What about a trial? What about justice? You just decide, and that’s the way it goes?’ ‘I’m a cop,’ Miller said, surprised by the apology in his voice. ‘Are you even human anymore?’”
