*ONE THING THAT I NOTICE DURING READING IS THAT THE CHAPTERS ALTERNATE BETWEEN HOLDEN AND MILLER. THE HOLDEN CHAPTERS ARE ON THE POINT OF VIEW OF HOLDEN AND HIS CREW. THE MILLER CHAPTERS ARE ALL ON HIS POINT OF VIEW, DURING THE CROSSROADS ON PAGE 238, IT WAS VERY CLEAR*
**You need to include eight entries in your reading journal. Your entries will be based on specific incidents** 
**in your novel as well as interpretations of your novel as a whole. The eight entries are outlined below.** 
1. **Create a reading schedule.** 
	Read chapters everyday at lunch and if possible during class time
2. **A short written reflection about why you chose your novel.** 
   The reason why I chose this novel is because I have seen the show adaptation three times. The show is called The Expanse and it is currently my favourite show of all time. I wanted to see the differences between the two mediums. As to why I liked the show, I love sci-fi shows and movies; it is my favourite genre. What is different about The Expanse is that the show takes place in approximately 200 years from now. Humanity has colonized the solar system but it not like star trek where there is no realism. This show is for the most part, physically accurate, and has realistic conflicts that are similar in ones in our history. 
3. **Notes about character development in two parts.** 
	What have you learned about the main character(s) from the first half of the novel?
	- Detective Miller
		- Detective Miller lived on Ceres as a police officer. He is a belter; a person who was born in the asteroid belt. Earth currently ‘owns’ Ceres and established Star Helix to enforce security; Miller works for them. Every belter hates Earth and Mars because they own them with an iron grip. He struggles with the internal conflict of working with the government that are actively oppressing his own people **ADD MORE**. 
		- He is able to see through cracks in the mystery of the Canterbury’s and Donnager’s destruction that others are unable to see. His stubbornness gets the better of him. Miller as always trying to find the next clue to the case. 
		- Miller was assigned to a case of a missing rich girl. He is very fascinated by her because she went from living well off on Earth to living in the slums of the Belt. He now sees her as hallucinations. He wants a comfort person as he is always lonely or with his detective partner. His wife left him years ago. 
		- He was tasked to look for a girl that caught the attention of those with much more power than him. ““ Miller gets fired but continues to look for her just this time without Star Helix’s resources. He has no idea who she is. Miller wanted more in his life. He was just a regular officer that was really good at his job. He is seen as boring to others.
	- James Holden
		- Holden is character that cares very deeply about his crewmates. He is willing to do anything to get them back, but he acts irrationally. He needs that voice of reason, which is his executive officer Naomi. After the destruction of the Canterbury, he has become more independent and fends off anyone who tries to hurt his ‘family’. Before he was just the executive officer of the Canterbury, and he was cheerful and a playboy. Holden is now the captain of his remaining crew. Holden felt the need to become stronger. **ADD MORE**. He does not the fit the stereotype of a strong man, yes he served in the military, but he does not know basic combat training when it comes down to actually fighting for his crew.
	How have the main character(s) changed, grown, or revealed themselves in the second half? 
	- Detective Miller
		- Miller has shown himself to be a stubborn person, a very rational being. He is able to realize that the world is not sunshine and rainbows. 
	- James Holden
		- Holden has shown himself to be an emotional person, one who cannot think 2 steps ahead. He deeply cares about his crew and will not under any circumstances get them hurt.
