# What is this thing about?
- Talking about how I had to confront who I was in terms of my academic journey.
	- I wish I did more during my 4 years of high school
		- Not having any friends made it harder for me to have the confidence to join clubs. 
		- Mr. Pinto asked me to join robotics - *state reason why*
- I went to Toronto to visit UTSG
	- This was the first time I have ever been on a subway. 
		- **Describe the rush**  - The walls were rushing past more, or really, I was rushing past the walls. Some people were fast asleep. Some people were reading a book; flicking their the pages with their fingers. This was the first time I have ever been on a subway. On the subway ceilings, there was an enclave of advertisements, each which distinctive messages. **Talk about the map with LEDs**
	- It was very exhilarating. I felt dreamy when I was there. I kept thinking about how my life for the next 4 years would be there.
		- **Describe scenery** - *make it feel like a dream*, sight, smell, hearing (bustling city)
		  Looking at the city that I could live in, I was flying throughout the different buildings. Vintage, brutalist, and modern; they were all **….** From the turkey-like architecture of Robarts Library, to the **….** I could smell spicy but sweat aroma of the street food near the athletic center.
		- Then I though about the price
	- However in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the requirements for getting in the programs I want. I choose engineering science and computer science at UTSG. The requirements are staggering. I think there is a very low chance of me getting in
		- I kept comparing myself to others in my school and online.
			- **Describe the feeling** - *taste, touch, sight*
			- It was the feeling of being in a black room when a thick and firm hand touching my shoulder and directing my eyes to multiple fish-eye lensed perspectives of students winning contests and awards. 
		- There are some robotics kids in my classes that are much smarter than me; there are more like them all across Ontario.
			- My brother is in Robotics, and other clubs like Model UN. He is already doing much better than I ever was and he is in grade 10. 
- I also went to Toronto to go to a car show
	- We had to park far which meant that we had to walk through the streets. 
		- Many homeless people
			- Toronto is very expensive,
			- City life seamed glamourous because I only ever lived in the suburbs. I’ve grown sick and tired of having to drive everywhere. However this **glamorous feeling only can materialize if you have a good job.**
			-  If I do not get into my programs that I want, would I end up with a job or no job which will make me end up like the people I saw on the streets?
				- This made me worry about the risk of AI impacting my future career choices. Will I have to settle with a lower salary than promised a year ago?
- Past heritage, identity?
	- Before I moved to Hamilton, I had many friends, some of which I still talk to everyday. I could not see my friends in person everyday. 
		- I had
	- I always wanted to be the smartest in my class ever since grade 5. I remember beating everyone in quick multiplication games.
