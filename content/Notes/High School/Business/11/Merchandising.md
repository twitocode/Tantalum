# Merchandising
## Types of companies

### Merchandising Company
A company that sells a "product" not a "service" (wholesalers and retailers)


### Manufacturing Company
A company that produces the products and sells them to merchandising companies.


## Net Income for a Merchandising Company

### Profit Formula
$$\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$$


### Net Income/Loss Formula
$$\text{Net Income/Loss} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Expenses}$$
- Income occurs when the $\text{Revenue} > \text{Expenses} + \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$
- Loss occurs when the $\text{Revenue} < \text{Expenses} + \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$


### Why is Cost of Goods sold included in the income statement?
Because a company must pay for the items it sells.





## Schedule of Cost of Goods Sold
Provides in detail how the Cost of goods sold is determined.  It is done because all costs related to purchasing the merchandise must be recorded.
$$\text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}$$



$$\text{Net Purchases} = \text{Purchases} - \text{Purchase Returns and Allowances} - \text{Purchase Discounts}$$
