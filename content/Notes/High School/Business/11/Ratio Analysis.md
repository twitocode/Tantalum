<!--ID: 1718469261452-->



## Working Capital

$$\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabiltiies}$$
<!--ID: 1718469261489-->


## Current Ratio
$$\frac{\text{Total Current Assets}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}}$$
Ex. 2.8 : 1 ratio
For every dollar of current Liability, this company has 2.8 dollars of current Assets.
(>= 2 : 1 ratio is good)
<!--ID: 1718469261523-->


## Quick Ratio
$$\frac{\text{Current Assets (Only Cash, A/R, and Securities)}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}}$$
(>= 1:1 ratio is good)
<!--ID: 1718469261556-->


## Inventory Turnover Period
Indicates the time it takes for a company to sell and then replace its inventory.
$$\frac{\text{Ending Inventory}}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} \cdot 365$$
If it is too high, then storage costs are high and profits are reduced. If it is too low, then sales may be lost because of the lack of merchandise.
(35-45 days is good)
<!--ID: 1718469556932-->


## Accounts Receivable Turnover Period
Indicates the average time it takes a company to collect its A/R accounts
$$\frac{\text{Accounts Receievable}}{\text{Net Sales on Credit}} \cdot 365$$
(45 days is good)
<!--ID: 1718469261590-->


# Borrowing Capacity Ratios

## Equity Ratio (%)
Indicates the percentage of assets financed by the owner
$$\frac{\text{Owner's Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}  \cdot 100$$
<!--ID: 1718469261623-->


## Debt Ratio (%)
Indicates the percentage of assets financed through debt (loan, credit)
$$\frac{\text{Total Debts}}{\text{Total Assets}} \cdot 100$$
> [!INFO] IMPORTANT
> A business owner favours **low equity ratios** and **high debt ratios** if the debt interest is low
> A lender prefers a company to have a **higher equity ratio** (low debt ratio indicates the ability to repay a loan)
> ___

<!--ID: 1718469261656-->






# Profitability Analysis

## Rate of Return on Net Sales
Indicates the percentage of sales that represent profit
$$\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Sales}} \cdot 100$$
<!--ID: 1718469261689-->


## Rate of Return on Average Owner's Equity
### Step 1
$$\text{Average OE} = \frac{\text{Beginning OE + Ending OE}}{2}$$
### Step 2
$$\text{Rate of Return on Average OE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average OE}} \cdot 100$$
The rate of return should be higher than the rate of return an owner could receive from other forms of investments (Stock Market, Deposits in Bank, Bonds)
