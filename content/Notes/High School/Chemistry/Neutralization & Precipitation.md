# Predicting Precipitation Formation
Solubility curves are used in chemical applications to determine whether a reaction will result in the formation of a precipitate. For example,
<!--ID: 1757893916190-->


$\ce{Ag+ + Cl- <=> AgCl_{(s)}}$

$[Ag^+]$
____________________________
$[Cl^-]$

This curve gives all the possible combinations of concentrations which are likely to result in the formation of a precipitate at a given temperature. If the product of concentrations is above the curve, a precipitate forms. A product below the curve indicates that the solution is unsaturated while products on the curve result in saturated solutions.

# Example 1
50.0 mL of both 0.100 mol/L $\ce{Pb(NO3)2}$ and 0.015 mol/L KI solutions are mixed together. A yellow precipitate forms. Determine the type of precipitate formed in a quantitative manner.

Solution:
$\ce{Pb(NO3)2_{(s)} -> Pb^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2NO3^-_{(aq)}}$

After examining solubility rules, $\ce{Pb(NO3)2_{(s)}}$ is likely to dissociate completely into ions.

Amount of $\ce{Pb(NO3)2}$ = C × V
= 0.100 mol/L × 0.050 L
= 0.005 mol

Note: $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}]_{new}$ = 0.005 mol (after mixing)
0.100 L
= 0.05 mol/L

$[\ce{NO3^-}]_{new}$ = 2(0.005 mol)
0.100 L
= 0.10 mol/L

$\ce{KI_{(s)} -> K^+_{(aq)} + I^-_{(aq)}}$

Again, KI is expected to completely dissociate into ions as predicted by solubility rules.

Amount of KI = C × V
= 0.015 mol/L × 0.050 L
= 0.000 75 mol

$[K^+]_{new}$ = $[I^-]_{new}$ = 0.000 75 mol (after mixing)
0.100 L
= 7.5 × 10^-3 mol/L

Possible Precipitates
- According to solubility rules, $\ce{KNO3}$ is not likely to form.
- $\ce{PbI2}$ is a possible precipitate resulting the following equilibrium.

$\ce{PbI2_{(s)} <=> Pb^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2I^-_{(aq)}}$

$K_{sp}$ = $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}][\ce{I^-}]^2$
$K_{sp}$ = (0.05 mol/L)(7.5 × 10^-3 mol/L)^2
= 2.8 × 10^-6 mol^3/L^3

However, $K_{sp}$ = 8.5 × 10^-9 mol^3/L^3 (from tables)

Since the experimental product of $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}]$ and $[\ce{I^-}]^2$ is greater than the $K_{sp}$ (2.8 × 10^-6 > 8.5 × 10^-9), a precipitate will form.

If the product of $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}]$ and $[\ce{I^-}]^2$ was less than $K_{sp}$, no precipitate would form.

# Example 2
Should precipitation occur when 50.0 mL of 5.00 × 10^-4 mol/L calcium nitrate solution is mixed with 50.0 mL of 2.00 × 10^-4 mol/L sodium fluoride solution. The $K_{sp}$ for calcium fluoride is 1.7 × 10^-10 (mol/L)^3.
<!--ID: 1757893916196-->


Solution:
- $\ce{NaNO3}$ is not likely to precipitate according to solubility rules.
$\ce{CaF2_{(s)} <=> Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2F^-_{(aq)}}$

After mixing, $[\ce{Ca^{2+}}]$ = 50 mL × 5.0 × 10^-4 mol/L
100 mL
= 2.5 × 10^-4 mol/L

and $[\ce{F^-}]$ = 50 mL × 2.0 × 10^-4 mol/L
100 mL
= 1.0 × 10^-4 mol/L

Since $K_{sp}$ = $[\ce{Ca^{2+}}][\ce{F^-}]^2$

Then $K_{sp}$ = (2.5 × 10^-4 mol/L)(1.0 × 10^-4 mol/L)^2
= 2.5 × 10^-12 (mol/L)^3

Since the experimentally determined solubility product [2.5 × 10^-12 (mol/L)^3] is less than the theoretical $K_{sp}$ [1.7 × 10^-10 (mol/L)^3], a precipitate will not form.
