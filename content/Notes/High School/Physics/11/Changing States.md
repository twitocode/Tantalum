# Why does the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] not change during phase changes?
[[Thermal Energy]] is being transformed into [[Energy|Chemical Potential Energy]] to make or break bonds, not [[Mechanical Energy|Kinetic Energy]], therefore, **the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] does not change.**

- **Melting and boiling**: [[Thermal Energy]] absorbed by the particles of a substance is converted to [[Energy|Chemical Potential Energy]] to break the bonds that hold the particles together
- **Condensation and freezing**: [[Thermal Energy]] is released to allow the particles to move closer together and become more organized
