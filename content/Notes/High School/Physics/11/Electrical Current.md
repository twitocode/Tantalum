# Electrical Current
The rate of electron flow
$$I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t}$$
Q is in Coulombs ($6.2 \cdot 10^{-18}$ electrons)
I = is Amperes (A)

A current of 1A means over 6 billion electrons moving past a point each second.

| When scientists first began studying circuits, **they assumed that positive charges** flowed through the wires in a circuit | After scientists learned more about the structure of atoms, they concluded that **current consists of electrons (negative charges)** |


## Direct Current
Current flows in only one direction.
<!--ID: 1718124839376-->


Used in all electrical equipment that is powered by a battery.

## Alternating Current
Current changes direction periodically - the charges move back and forth over the same spot and do not actually move from one terminal to another.
<!--ID: 1717163511436-->


Used in all electrical equipment plugged into an outlet.
<!--ID: 1716814411793-->


## Ammeter
Used to measure electrical current. Must be connected in **series** so that all electrons flowing through the wire also have to flow through the ammeter
<!--ID: 1716814411804-->

## Kirchhoff's Current Law
In a closed circuit, the amount of current entering a junction is equal to the amount of current exiting a junction.
