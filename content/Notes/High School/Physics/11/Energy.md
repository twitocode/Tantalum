| Form                        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Radiant                     | The energy of **electromagnetic waves**                                                                                                                      |
| Kinetic                     | The energy possessed by an object due to its **motion**                                                                                                      |
| Sound                       | The energy in **sound waves**                                                                                                                                |
| [[Thermal Energy\|Thermal]] | The energy associated with the **movement and interactions of the particles** in an object (The total kinetic and potential energy of an object's particles) |

### Potential Energy
The ability of an object to do work because of its position or the arrangement of its parts. It may be considered **a stored from of energy**.

| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Mechanical Energy\|Gravitational]] | The potential energy possessed by an object due to its **height**.                      |
| Elastic                              | The potential energy stored in an object when it is **temporarily forced out of shape** |
| Chemical                             | The potential energy stored in **chemical bonds**                                       |
| Nuclear                              | The potential energy stored in the **nucleus of an atom**                               |
| Electrical                           | The potential energy associated with **electric charges**                               |

## Energy Efficiency
The ratio of the amount of useful energy produced ($E_{out}$) to the amount of energy used ($E_{in}$)
$$\text{\% eff} = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}} \cdot 100$$
$E_{out}$ is the useful energy output
$E_{in}$ is the total energy input
**Most Energy is wasted in the form of [[Thermal Energy]]**
