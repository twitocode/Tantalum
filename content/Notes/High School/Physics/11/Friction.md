# Friction
A force that resists motion between two objects in contact.
$$\vec{F}_{F} = \mu_{f}\vec{F}_{N}$$
In most cases, $F_{N} = F_{g}$ so we can calculate $F_N = mg$

## Static Friction ($\vec{F}_{{Fs}}$)
This type of friction prevents an object at rest from moving. The **object remains are rest because the static friction is equal in magnitude** and opposite in direction **to the applied force**
___
Once the applied force overcomes the Maximum amount of static friction ($\vec{F}_{\text{s max}}$), then the object will start moving. If there are two or more objects, then you must overcome the combined maximum force of static friction to cause the objects to move.

## Kinetic Friction ($\vec{F}_{{Fk}}$)
This type of friction occurs when an object is sliding on another. It is a force exerted on a moving object by a surface and acts opposite to the direction. **If the object moves at a constant velocity, then the applied force must be equal in magnitude to the kinetic friction**

## Coefficient of Friction ($\mu _f$)
Different surfaces in contact have different amounts of friction acting on them.
Coefficients of friction are **determined experimentally** for two objects in contact and i**s a level of how "slippery" the two object in contact are**.
$$F_{f} = \mu_{f}F_{N}$$

Usually the force required to start and object moving is greater than the resistance to keep an object moving. Therefore, $\mu_s$ is usually greater than $\mu_k$
