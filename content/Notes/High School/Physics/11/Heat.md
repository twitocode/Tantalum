# What is Heat?
**The transfer of [[Thermal Energy]]** from a warmer object to a colder object.


> [!IMPORTANT] Heat vs [[Thermal Energy]]
> Heat is a **verb**
> [[Thermal Energy]] is a **noun**

## Methods of Transferring [[Thermal Energy]]

| **Heat Transfer** | Collision of atoms. Atoms are heated and gain kinetic energy and vibrate quicker. | Circulating paths of fluids          | Electromagnetic waves                |

## What are Thermal Conductors?
Allow [[Thermal Energy]] to pass through them easily an quickly


## What are Thermal Insulators?
Do not allow [[Thermal Energy]] pass through them easily



# What is Specific Heat Capacity?
The amount of energy needed to increase the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] of a 1.0kg of substance by 1°C



> [!EXAMPLE] Water
> Water's specific heat capacity is $4.18 \cdot 10^3 J/(kg\cdot \text{°C})$ meaning it takes $4.18 \cdot 10^3 J/(kg\cdot \text{°C})$ of energy to increase the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] of 1kg of water by 1°C

# What is Quantity of Heat $Q$?
The total amount of [[Thermal Energy]] transferred from a warmer substance to a colder substance
>
$$Q = mc\Delta T$$
$Q$ is measured in Joules
$T$ is measured in °C
