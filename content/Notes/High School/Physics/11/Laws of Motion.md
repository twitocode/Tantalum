# Laws of Motion

## First Law of Motion
An object at rest remains at rest. An object in motion stays at constant velocity unless enacted on by a net external force.
___
Objects **at rest**                                           $\vec{F}_{net} = 0N$
Objects moving at **constant velocity** $\vec{F}_{net} = 0N$

Describes motion of an object in **isolation**.


### Inertia
The property of matter that causes it **to resist changes in motion**. It is directly proportional to the mass of the object
A boulder will be harder to stop than a feather.

### Important Implications
1. A **non-zero net force** will **change the velocity of an object**. The velocity can change in magnitude, direction, or both. If $\vec{F}_{net} =0$ then there will be no change in velocity. If $\vec{F}_{net} \neq 0$ then there is a net force acting upon the objects
2. A net force is **not required** to maintain the velocity of an object.
3. **External forces** (i.e. An applied force) **are required to change the motion of an object**. Internal forces have no effect on the motion of an object
## Second Law of Motion
If the **net force on an object is not zero**, the object will accelerate in the direction of this net force
$$ \vec{F}_{net} = m \vec{a} $$
### Where:
$m$ is in $kg$
$\vec{a}$ is in $m/s^2$
$\vec{F}_{net}$ is in Newtons ($N$)

Describes motion of an object in **isolation**
The **magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force** and **inversely proportional to the mass of the object.**

### Steps to solve Force Problems
1. Draw a [[Forces|FBD]]. Be sure to label the positive direction.
2. Write an equation:
$\vec{F}_{net} = \Sigma F$ (sum of all forces acting on the object)
3. If the object is at rest or moving with a constant velocity, rewrite $\vec{F}_{net}$ Â as 0.
4. If the object is accelerating, rewrite $\vec{F}_{net}$ as $m \vec{a}$.
5. Rewrite $\vec{F}_{g}$ as $m \vec{g}$ if applicable.
6. Plug in known values.
7. Solve for the unknown variable.

## Third Law of Motion
For every **action force**, there is a **simultaneous reaction force** that is **equal** **in magnitude** but **opposite in direction.**
$$ \vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = - \vec{F}_{\text{B on A}} $$

Describes the motion of objects that are **interacting**.
