## Earth's Magnetic Field
- Generated in our planet's interior and extends out into space
- Earth has two sets of poles - **geographic poles** and **magnetic poles**
- The magnetic poles are relatively close (about 500 km away) from the geographic poles.

## The Compass
A magnetized needle is placed on a pivot so that it may rotate freely.
Earth's magnetic field exerts a force on the compass needle, causing it to rotate until it come stop rest in the same direction as the magnetic field (North).
