# Mechanical [[Energy ]]
The **sum** of an object's **kinetic energy** and **gravitational potential energy**.
$$E_{m} = E_{k} + E_{g}$$
<!--ID: 1715686690924-->


## Kinetic Energy ($E_{k}$)
The energy possessed by moving objects, It is a **scalar** quantity

$$E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$$
<!--ID: 1715686690927-->

## The Relationship Between [[Mechanical Work]] and Kinetic Energy
$$W = \Delta E_{k}$$
$$W = E_{k_{f}} - E_{k_{i}}$$


## Work-Energy Principle
Work is the change in energy
$$W = \Delta E_{k}$$
<!--ID: 1715686690930-->



## Gravitational Potential Energy ($E_k$)
The energy possessed by an object due to its **height**
$$E_{g} = mgh$$
