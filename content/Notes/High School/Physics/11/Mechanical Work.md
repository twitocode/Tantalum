# Mechanical Work
The [[Energy]] transferred to an object by a force applied over a measured distance
$$W = F\Delta d$$
<!--ID: 1715686690918-->


> [!ERROR] Important
> - The magnitude of the force must be constant
> - The applied force and displacement must be in the same direction.
> - It is a **Scalar** Quantity
> - Measured in Joules ($J$)

### When Force and Displacement are in different directions
$$ W = F\cos \theta \Delta d$$

### Zero Work
The work done by a force is **zero** when

1. The **displacement is 0**
2. The **force is 0** (not even friction)
3. The **force and displacement are perpendicular** to each other
