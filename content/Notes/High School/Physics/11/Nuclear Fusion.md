# Nuclear Fusion
A nuclear reaction in which the nuclei of two atoms fuse to form another element. In nature, it happens in stars

> [!INFO]
> In order for nuclear fusion to occur, the fusing nuclei must **have enough kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic force** between them

## Nuclear Stability
The higher the binding energy, the more stable the nucleus is. (iron-56 is the most stable, with the most tightly bound nucleus).

Usually hydrogen is used for fusion while Uranium is used for fission

| Heavier Nuclei                                                              | Light Nuclei                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most likely to undergo [[Nuclear Fission]] because binding energy increases | Most likely to undergo nuclear fusion because binding energy increases |
| Products are more stable than the reactant                                  | Product is more stable than reactants                                  |

## Fusion Processes

### Proton-Proton Chain
Four hydrogen nuclei fuse to form one helium-4 atom
Occurs in stars the of our sun and smaller
$$4(^1_{1}H) \to ^4_{2}He + 2(^0_{+1}e) + energy$$

#### Nucleosynthesis
The process of forming larger elements from smaller ones via nuclear fusion is known as nucleosynthesis.


### Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen Cycle
Occurs in stars that are significantly larger and hotter than the Sun
A carbon-12 nucleus undergoes a number of nuclear reactions involving fusion and decay.
$$^{12}_{6}C \to ^{13}_{7}N \to ^{13}_{6}C \to ^{14}_{7}N \to ^{15}_{8}O \to ^{15}_{7}N \to ^{12}_{6}C + ^4_{2}He$$
