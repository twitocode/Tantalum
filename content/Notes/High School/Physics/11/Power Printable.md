# Power
The **rate at which [[Energy]] is transformed**; or the **rate at which [[Mechanical Work|Work]] is done**
$$P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$
Power is measured in Watts ($W$) (Joules per second)
![[Figure_08_07_02a.jpg]]
In this case, the amount of work is the same, only the time is changing.
## Energy Ratings
The energy used (transformed) by an electrical appliance, $\Delta{E}$
the amount of electrical energy used is usually measured in kilowatt hours ($kWh$)
### Electrical Energy
$$\Delta E = P \Delta t$$
### Cost
$$\cos t = \Delta E \cdot rate$$
