# Properties of Waves

## Wavelength (in $\text{metres}$)
The distance between two similar points in successive identical cycles in a wave
(ie. Crest to crest or trough to trough)


## Amplitude
The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium point

## Waveform
The shape of a wave when graphed

## Crest
The **maximum** point of a transverse wave


## Trough
The **minimum** point of a transverse wave


## Phase Shift (in $\text{metres}$)
<!-- Grade 12 math very easy with radians-->
A shift of an entire wave along the x-axis

## Frequency (f)
The number of complete cycles that occur in unit time in hertz
$$f = \frac{\text{Number of cycles}}{\text{Unit time (s)}}$$

### Hertz ($hz$)
Cycles per second


## Period ($T$)
The time taken for a vibrating particle to complete one cycle (seconds)
$$T = \frac{\text{time (s)}}{\text{Number of cycles}} $$


## Wave Speed Formula ($v$)
$$v = \frac{\text{wavelength (m)}}{\text{period (s)}}$$
