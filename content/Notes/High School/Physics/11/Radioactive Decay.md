# Radioactive Decay
When unstable isotopes try to balance themselves by getting rid of their excess protons or neutrons

- The nucleus of an atom contains protons (+) and neutrons (0)
- The positively-charged protons repel each other (electrostatic forces)
- However, the nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force which is always attractive and much stronger than electrostatic forces

## Unstable Isotopes
- **Atoms with too many protons or too many neutrons**, upsetting the strong nuclear forces
- Try to balance themselves by getting rid of their excess protons or neutrons
- Unstable nuclei are radioactive and emit [[Atoms and Isotopes|Radiation]]

## Radiation
The emission of [[Energy]] in the form of waves or fast-moving particles
The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic-wave, the more energy it carries

### Ionizing Radiation (Gamma, X-Ray)
Waves or particles that carry enough energy to remove an electron from an atom or molecule

# Types of Radioactive decay

## Alpha Decay
It is the most common form of decay. A helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons) is spontaneously emitted from the nucleus
$$^A_{Z}X \to ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^4_{2}He$$

## Beta Declay

### Beta-Negative Decay
- When a nucleus contains too many neutrons, the strong nuclear force becomes much greater than the   electrostatic force
- **A neutron will spontaneously decay into a proton and electron to maintain stability**
- **An electron is emitted from the nucleus of a parent atom**
$$^A_{Z}X \to ^{A}_{Z+1}Y + ^{\text{0}}_{-1}e$$

<!--ID: 1715895327969-->


### Beta-Positive Decay
- A proton changes into a neutron and a positron (a particle with a positive charge and the same mass as an electron
$$^A_{Z}X \to ^{A}_{Z-1}Y + ^{\text{0}}_{+1}e$$

### Electron Capture
An electron is absorbed by a nucleus and combines with a proton to form a neutron
**Mass stays the same but a proton is lost**
$$^A_{Z}X + ^{\text{0}}_{-1}e \to ^{A}_{Z-1}Y$$

## Gamma Decay
- After a nuclear reaction has occurred, the daughter (new) nucleus is an a high-energy (excited) state
- The nucleus spontaneously releases energy (gamma ray) to return to a lower, more stable energy state
$$^3_{2}He ^\star \to ^{3}_{2}He + ^0_{0}\gamma$$

### Gamma ray
highly energetic form of electromagnetic radiation emitted as a photon (high energy particle with no mass)
