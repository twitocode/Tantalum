# Resistance ($R$)

A measure of the opposition to the flow of Current
<!--ID: 1717163511430-->


## Resistor
A device that has a specific resistance value. As charges move through a resistor, the resistor removed energy from he charges and converts it to another type of energy, usually [[Thermal Energy]]

## Ohm's Law
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$

| Voltage & Current | Resistance & Current   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| $V \alpha I$      | $I \alpha\frac{ I}{R}$ |

## In Parallel Circuits
The total resistance is always less than any individual resistor.
$$\frac{1}{R_{T}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} +\dots + \frac{1}{R_{n}}$$
