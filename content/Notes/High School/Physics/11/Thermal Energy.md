# Thermal Energy
The total amount of kinetic and chemical potential energy possessed by the particles of a substance. (Kinetic - motion of the particles; Potential - force of attraction between the particles) **It is not the same as [[Heat]]**
> [!NOTE] It Depends on
> - How fast the particles of a substance move
> - The quantity of particles in a substance

## Kinetic Molecular Theory
Matter is composed of particles (atoms and molecules) that attract each other and have kinetic energy.
Since these particles have kinetic energy, they are in a state of constant motion

| State  | Kinetic Energy   | Particle Movement                       |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Solid  | Very Little      | Vibrate only                            |
| Liquid | More than solids | Move and slide past one another (flow)  |
| Gas    | A lot            | Move freely and rapidly past each other |

## What is Temperature?
The **average Kinetic Energy** of the particles in an object

### Why can't we measure [[Thermal Energy]]?
We cannot measure the total amount of thermal energy in an object because it is impossible to measure the kinetic and potential energy of every particle within the object.
