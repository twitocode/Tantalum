# Velocity
The total [[Displacement]] of an object in [[Motion]] divided by the total time taken for that [[Motion]].
It describes the change in [[Position]] over time.
It is a **Vectory Quantity**
$$\vec{v}_{av} = \frac{\Delta \vec{d}}{\Delta t} $$


## Uniform Velocity
[[Motion]] at a constant speed in a straight line


## Non-Uniform
Motion that is not at a constant speed or not in a straight line. Also called [[Acceleration|accelerated]] motion
