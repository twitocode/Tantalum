# Waves

## Vibration
The cyclical motion of an object about an equilibrium point
<!--ID: 1718216451476-->


## Mechanical Wave
The transfer of energy through a material by particle vibration.
![[Water-2016.gif]]
- Water waves move away from the point of the original disturbance.
- The water itself is not moving; rather it is a rearrangement of the water’s surface.
- We could consider a wave to be the motion of a disturbance

## Net Motion
The displacement of a particle over a certain time interval.
- After a wave has passed through a medium, the particles return to their original location so ideally, **their net displacement is zero**.
- Therefore, **no work is done** on them by the wave – **no energy is lost** and it can continue indefinitely.

## What is a Medium?
The material through which a mechanical wave travels. (Solid, Liquid, Gas)
- A vibration is able to travel through a medium because **each molecule in the medium is connected to neighbouring molecules by intermolecular forces**.
- This allows a mechanical wave to be one of the most efficient forms of energy transmission in nature.

### Efficiency of Vibration Transfer

| Solid | LIquid    | Gas |
| ----- | --------- | --- |
| High  | very good | Low |

## Transverse Waves
The direction of the wave is perpendicular to the motion of the source
Ex. Water

## Longitudinal Waves
The travel of the wave is in the same direction to the motion of the source.
