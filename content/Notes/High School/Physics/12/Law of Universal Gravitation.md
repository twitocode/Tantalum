Newton discovered that [[Gravity]] attracts any two objects depending on their masses and their distance apart

$$\vec{F}_{g} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$Gravitational Constant: $G = 1.67\times10^{-11} \frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$


## Gravitational Fields
A collection of vectors that determines the magnitude and direction of gravitational force.
$$g = \frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$$

> [!INFO] Altitude
> To get the altitude of a satellite:
> Subtract the orbital radius by the radius of the planet

## Orbits & Satellites
### Orbital Velocity $v$
$$F_{g} = F_{c}$$
$$\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}=\frac{m_{1}v^2}{r}$$
$$\sqrt{ \frac{Gm}{r} }=v$$

Where $m$ is the mass of the planet the satellite is orbiting around
Too much speed and it escapes the atmosphere, Too little speed and it will burn up or fall into earth.

### Orbital Period $T$
$$F_{g} = F_{c}$$
$$\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}=\frac{m_{1}4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$
$$4\pi^2r^3 = Gm_{2}T^2$$
$$\sqrt{ \frac{4\pi^2r^3}{Gm} } = T$$
### Orbital Radius $r$
$$\sqrt[3]{ \frac{Gm_{2}T^2}{4\pi^2} } = r$$
#### Geosynchronous Orbit
When the orbital period of a satellite is equal to the period of rotation of a planet on its axis

#### Geostationary Orbit
When a satellite lies in the same plane as the equator
