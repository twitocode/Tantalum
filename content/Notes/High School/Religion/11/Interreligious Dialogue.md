# Interreligious Dialogue

## 4 Types of Interreligious Dialogue
1. Everyday life
2. Action
3. Theological Exchange
4. Religious Experiences


## The Dialogue of Everyday life
Dialogue of courtesy, openness, and becoming a good neighbour.


## The Dialogue of Action
Work with other religions for the well being of humanity.
- safeguard rights of individuals
- promote peopleâ€™s aspirations for happiness, to protect nature
- show solidarity with victims of injustice
- to struggle for peace and justice


## The Dialogue of Theological Exchange
Once mutual trust has been gained we can tackle difficult issues such as bitterness from past actions, inconsistencies in each others positions, prejudices and human right



## The Dialogue of Religious Experiences
Discussion of their own spirituality. What they believe in, their prayer life, and how they search for God. This can lead not only to a deep appreciation of what moves members or other religions, but also to a deeper appreciation of our own faith.
