# Islam Concepts
## Jihad
The struggle against anything that distracts one from receiving Allah or acting in accordance with Allah's will.

## Tawba
A four-step process of repentance
1. Feel remorseful about the sin
2. Repent of one’s action to God by saying, “My Lord forgive me”
3. Make restitution for the sin if possible
4. Resolve never to do the sin again.

## Salam
"**and upon you be peace**"
