# Islam's Sacred Books
The three books form the [[Shariah]] law.

## Qu'ran
**The direct revealed record of God**. It is the complete, accurate and final book. Best understood in Arabic, "The language of angels".
It gives guidance on how to worship, behave, and to see the world

There are 114 Suras (Chapters) arranged longest to shorted.
It begins with "In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful"

## Sunna
**Is a collection of Muhammad’s own words and actions, as recorded by his friends and family**.
E.g. If he taught a prayer or explained a religious practice, his followers would carefully record what he said and did.

## Hadith
**Is a collection of Muhammad’s words, actions, and his statement about current religious practices by others** (and whether or not he approved of those practices). Contains stories about what Muhammed is like in person.

### Comparison to The Sunna
Hadith **is not** based on first person accounts by Muhammad’s inner circle of followers and authenticity is debated.
