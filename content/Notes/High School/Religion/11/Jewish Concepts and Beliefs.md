# Jewish Concepts and Beliefs

## Diaspora
The scattering of Jews outside of Israel in both ancient and modern times



## Halakha
"Jewish law" "how to behave" something like that.



## Messiah
A word meaning “the anointed one”, the word “Christ” comes from the Greek word meaning the same thing



## Zionism
A movement that began in the 19th century for the purpose of creating a Jewish state what is now modern Israel.
It now refers to strong support for the state of Israel.



## Covenant
An agreement of mutual faithfulness, like a contract or alliance between two parties.
Most start with God's reason for making the covenant. The foundation of the covenant is God freeing the Hebrews from slavery.



The conditions are that you must submit to God.

## Mitzvot
"Laws"/"Commandments" but most accurately "**Guidance**". It spells out how Jews can mirror out the holiness of God through the [[Jewish Concepts and Beliefs|Covenant]] in their daily lives. It helps them live "right" relationships with God.
