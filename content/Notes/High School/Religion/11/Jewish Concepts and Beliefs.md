## Covenant
An agreement of mutual faithfulness, like a contract or alliance between two parties.
Most start with God's reason for making the covenant. The foundation of the covenant is God freeing the Hebrews from slavery.

The conditions are that you must submit to God.

## Mitzvot
"Laws"/"Commandments" but most accurately "**Guidance**". It spells out how Jews can mirror out the holiness of God through the [[Jewish Concepts and Beliefs|Covenant]] in their daily lives. It helps them live "right" relationships with God.
