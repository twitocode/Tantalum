# Jewish Holidays and Festivals

## Hanukkah
"Festival of Lights". 8 day celebration. Jews are called to be the light to all nations.
It celebrates the Jewish victory over the Syrian Greeks in 165 B.C.E.  **During this event, Jews recaptured the Temple and rededicated it to God.**  While rededicating the Temple, Jews found a **menorah (candelabrum) that stayed lit for 8 days.  This was surprising because there was only enough oil to keep it lit for 1 day.**

## Passover
Jews retell the Passover story and have a **Seder** meal. It commemorates the time in the Biblical period **when God punished the Egyptians by killing their first-born children**.  God freed the Jews from bondage and spared them from death.  **God “passed over” the homes of the Jews.**
