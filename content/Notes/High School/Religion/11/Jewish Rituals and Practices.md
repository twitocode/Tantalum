# Jewish Rituals and Practices


## Kosher
Food that is permitted to be eaten according to Jewish dietary laws (Kashruth).
The reason why Jews observe kosher laws is to remind themselves that they are to be a **holy and separate people.**
The laws are found in Leviticus 2 and Deuteronomy. You need 2 sets of kitchen equipment, **one for milk and one for dairy.**
