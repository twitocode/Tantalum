# Mosque (Masjid)
A place of worship for Muslims. Masjid means the place of prostration.
Prostrating is an act of complete surrender to [[Allah]].
There are separate areas for men and women so that they don't distract each other.
Prayer mats must be pointed towards the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. The Qiblah is on the wall of the mosque which is always in the direction of [[Mecca]].
