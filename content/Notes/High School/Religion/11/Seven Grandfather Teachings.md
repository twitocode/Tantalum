# Seven Grandfather Teachings
The Seven Grandfather Teachings are a set of Anishinaabe guiding principles that give people the tools for how to live a good life
## History
There were Seven Grandfathers who were given the responsibility by the Creator to watch over the Earth’s people.
• They saw that life was not good, so they sent a helper, the Oshkabaywis, to walk among the people and bring them someone who could be taught how to live in harmony with Creation.
• It took seven tries but eventually the Oshkabaywis brought them a baby and they were happy.
• They instructed the Oshkabaywis to take the baby to every corner of the earth to see all of Creation.
• This took seven years and when they returned, each of the Grandfathers gave the child a gift – a teaching – to share with all the Earth’s people.

## Love

## Respect
To honour all of creation. Its mutual and reciprocal. The **bison/buffalo** was at one time a significant resource for Anishinaabe people, giving every part of itself to sustain human life for food, clothing and shelter.
## Truth

To Cherish Knowledge, use it for the good of all. Wisdom is represented by the **beaver**, who uses its natural gifts of sharp teeth wisely to cut logs and branches to build dams

To face your foes with integrity and do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant. The **mother bear** has the courage and strength to face her fears and challenges while protecting her young.
## Honesty
To be sincere when facing a situation. Be honest first with yourself. Honesty is represented by the **Sabe or sometimes the raven**. The Sabe and raven accepts themselves for who they are and does not look to try to be like others.
