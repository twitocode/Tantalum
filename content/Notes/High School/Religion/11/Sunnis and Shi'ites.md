## Shias
- **Split from the Sunnis** over leadership
- **Ali (Father of Fatimah) is the first Imam**
- Husayn (Ali’s younger son) atoned from the sins of Muslims by dying in battle therefore he is viewed as a martyr among the Shias
- **They recognize 11 Imams and believe the 12th is in hiding and will reemerge to rule**: all Imams died mysteriously except for the last one referred to as the Mahdi
- **The Shias believe that the Qur’an was tampered with by enemies of Ali since it does not mention his name**
- They search for hidden meanings in the Qur’an and distrust the present world order
- The Shias are the dominant sect in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Lebanon

## Sufi
- A mystical movement
- The most famous Sufi was Al-Ghazali who lived in the 12th century
- **Al-Ghazali developed a theology of love as the root of all mystical relationships with Allah**
- The Sufis are the smallest group but are fairly influential
- **They do not follow Muslim rulers, salvation is more individualized**
- Believe that meditation and prolonged fasts will lead to illumination from Allah
- The word **sufi means “wool-wearers”** since they wear simple wool robe as a sign of their poverty

## Imams
### Sunni
The [[Imams]] in the Sunnis are local leaders of prayer
- Imam is a God-given post that is open only to a descendent of Muhammad through Ali
### Shia
Believed that [[Islam Prophets|Muhammad]] intended to be established a hereditary line of religious leaders called Imams to teach and guide the faithful
