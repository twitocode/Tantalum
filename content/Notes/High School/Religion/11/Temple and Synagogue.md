# Temple and Synagogue

## Temple
Was the center of Jewish worship for centuries until the scattering of the Jews and destruction of the temple in 70 CE. It was used for worshipping God and mainly for the ritual sacrifice of animals.

## Synagogue
They were built so that people **would not have to depend on temple.**
1. They are houses where torah is taught to all Jews.
2. They provide places of worship outside of Jerusalem.
Jews assemble there on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings.

### Ark and Torah
The [[Jewish Bible|Torah]] is kept in each synagogue in a cupboard called the **Ark** found on the eastern wall.
A lap called the eternal light always burns over the ark
