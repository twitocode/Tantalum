# Women in Islam
Islam is one of the most progressive supporters of women's liberation. It is why Islamic women support Muhammad's vision

In the [[Islam's Sacred Books|Qu'ran]], **men and women are equal**

## Women's Clothing
Women wear **hijab**, loose fitting clothes, and ankles and wrists should be covered
**Veils** over the face like the niquab, wearing an all-enveloping robe like the burka, and wearing socks and gloves. They may practice a form of female seclusion called purdah.

## Veils (Hijab)
Arabic word for cover, a scarf that covers most or all a women’s hair



Women should be judged on mind and personality not beauty or lack of it.
It is simply a woman’s assertion that judgement of her physical person is to play no role whatsoever in social interaction.

When Muslim women cover themselves, **they put themselves on a higher level and men will look at them with respect and will notice them for their intellect, faith, personality** not their beauty.

## Divorce
It is allowed, Talaq is male initiated divorce, Khul is female initiated divorce.
