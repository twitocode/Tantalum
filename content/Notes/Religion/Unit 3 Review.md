# Lectio Divina
Lectio Divina is a slow and meditative reading of the word of God. It is not speed reading or studying the word of God, but praying. It involves having the words "speak Lord, your servant is listening" in your heart. It includes quiet time to reflect on what God is saying to your head, heart, and hands, about how you might know, love, and serve Him. It involves resolving to bring one's heart in line with the heart of Christ through sacred scripture. It begins with the Sign of the Cross and involves letting go of mental clutter and barriers that prevent God from entering the heart, such as sins like pride, anger, and greed.
