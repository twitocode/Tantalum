# What is Prayer?
Prayer is a direct dialogue or communication between you and God, allowing for a living, intimate relationship. It involves your heart, mind, and body. Prayer requires active listening and active responses, just like communication with others.

# What does prayer allow us to tell God?
Prayer allows us to tell God how we feel, to praise Him, what we want, our guilt/contrition, and our worries.

# How do we keep our relationship with God alive through prayer?
- Prayers take time, sincerity, discipline, and attention.
- Prayer needs to be a regular part of our day.
- Prayer should focus on God, not on oneself.
- The celebration of the Eucharist is central to prayer and our religion, with all Catholics expected to participate in Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation.
- We need to make time to speak and listen to God daily, otherwise, our relationship with God will not grow.

# What is prayer a recognition of God?
Prayer is a recognition of God because people often turn to God in prayer or petition when they realize there are things they cannot do or get without God's help.

# What is prayer a test of faith?
Prayer is a test of faith because even though God answers all prayers, sometimes the answer is "yes" and other times it is "no". People with weak faith may interpret "no" as an unanswered prayer, believing God isn't listening or doesn't care. Sometimes, answers may not be what is expected, and one might have to wait. Jesus teaches us to be persistent and never give up in prayer.

# What are the Five Forms of Prayer?
1. **Petition:** A prayer for yourself, asking God for something you want, recognizing your need for help.
2. **Intercession:** A prayer for others, which helps our love for our neighbors grow and makes it easier to have faith and withstand temptation.
3. **Thanksgiving:** Thanking God for all things and expressing gratitude for gifts of life and love.
4. **Blessing and Adoration:** Admitting God is God (above us) and we are His creation (below Him). This prayer helps us recognize God's presence and understand that everything comes from Him and will return to Him.
5. **Praise:** Giving God glory for His own sake, simply because He is God. It involves understanding God's nature as all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful, and all-loving. We offer our entire life to God as a sacrifice of praise, realizing our love for Him.

# Why pray?
Prayer allows people to have a living, intimate relationship with God. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (para. 697), prayer is the life of the new heart and should animate us at every moment, serving as a remembrance of God. We cannot pray "at all times" if we do not pray at specific, consciously willed times. People often pray to be comforted, forgiven, to thank God for happiness, and to feel His presence.

# When should I pray?
You can pray anytime, as God always has time to listen. You can also pray during special times like Sundays, religious holidays, or during tragedy or need. Prayer can be done with others (class, church, family, friends, prayer groups) or alone, for private communication and expressing deep feelings.

# How do I pray?
To pray effectively and involve yourself completely with God, there are three steps:
1. **THINK:** Concentrate fully, use your mind to make sense of the world and your life, and try to see things from God's perspective.
2. **FEEL:** Fully express your emotions, as they help you relate to God.
3. **ACT:** Be yourself when you pray, as God knows who you are. Be giving and understanding to others and life situations, and develop a successful plan of action.

# What is the Lord's Prayer/Our Father?
The Lord's Prayer, also known as the Our Father, was taught by Jesus to his disciples. It is considered a summary of the Gospel and the most perfect prayer of the Church.

# Why is the Lord's Prayer the most perfect prayer?
The Lord's Prayer is considered the most perfect prayer for ten reasons:
- Jesus himself gave it to us.
- It teaches us how to pray.
- It is addressed to the Father.
- It helps us to know who God is.
- It helps us to know who we are.
- It helps us to be more like God our Father.
- It helps us to have loving and trusting hearts.
- It is about "we," not "me".
- It is the prayer of the Church.
- It is truly a summary of the whole Gospel.

# What are the seven petitions in the Lord's Prayer?
The Lord's Prayer has seven petitions:
1. **Hallowed be thy name:** A request to keep God's name holy, use it with reverence, and be in awe of God.
2. **Thy kingdom come:** Asking God to help us prioritize and do our part to bring His Kingdom of justice, peace, and love into being.
3. **Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven:** Asking God to help us give and receive love, as Jesus taught that God's will is for us to love one another.
4. **Give us this day our daily bread:** Asking for basic food for ourselves, families, friends, and everyone in the world, and remembering those hungry for God. "Our daily bread" can also refer to the Eucharist.
5. **Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us:** Recognizing that we all sin (trespass) and need forgiveness. Holding onto hurts or seeking revenge blocks God's love and forgiveness.
6. **Lead us not into temptation:** Asking God to help us avoid people and situations that could lead to sin or tragedy.
7. **But deliver us from evil:** Asking God to deliver us from things that would harm us or turn us away from Him, praying with confidence that good will triumph over evil.

# What is Lectio Divina?
Lectio Divina is a slow and meditative reading of the word of God, not speed reading or studying. It involves having the words "speak Lord, your servant is listening" in our hearts. It includes quiet time for reflection, asking what God is saying to our head, heart, and hands, and how we might know, love, and serve Him. The practice resolves to bring one's heart in line with Christ's heart through sacred scripture. It begins with the Sign of the Cross and involves letting go of mental clutter and barriers that prevent God from entering the heart, such as sins like pride, anger, and greed.

# What is a devotion?
A devotion is a non-liturgical prayer that expresses a person's faith. Common devotions include Lectio Divina, the Rosary, Stations of the Cross, and novenas. The Rosary combines vocal and mental prayer. The Stations of the Cross are usually done on Fridays of Lent. Novenas are prayers said for nine consecutive days.

# What are the traits of Jesus' Prayer Life?

Jesus prayed often:

- Jewish ritual of three times a day.
- When he preached.
- When he made choices.
- When he suffered.
- On the cross dying.

Jesus prayed in different settings:

- In private.

# What is the highest form of prayer for all Christians?
The Catholic Church teaches that the Holy Mass is the highest form of prayer for all Christians.

# What are Sacraments?
Sacraments are defined as efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites through which sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament, bearing fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.
