# Second Brains

>[!Summary]
>Second Brains are used to solve the problem of **information overload**

 The easiest solution to information overload is to write down what we consume. Most of us do not think about writing things down because "I will just remember it".

**Write down and thoughts you have during the day**

When you reduce the amount of knowledge your brain has to retain, you can reduce your stress levels. 

What are some changes that I can make to this???
