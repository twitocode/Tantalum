# Sacred Indigenous People

## Energy and the Great Spirit #flashcard 
Indigenous Peoples believe that all power comes from a common origin - the **same energy inhabits all things**
Some thing share a greater quantity of this spirit or energy, while others have less of it.
**We often address the Great Spirit as the Creator**. It reveals itself in nature and it is a power they encounter in everything.
