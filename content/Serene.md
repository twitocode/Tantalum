### How to Use This Template Effectively:

1. **Collaborate from Day One:** Frontend and backend teams should fill this out together. This ensures alignment and catches potential integration issues early.
    
2. **Iterate:** This is a living document. As your project evolves, so should this plan.
    
3. **Be Specific:** The more detail you provide, the clearer the path forward.
    
4. **Prioritize:** Not everything can be high priority. Focus on the core features first.
    
5. **Use Tools:** While this template is a document, integrate it with your chosen task management and version control systems.
    
6. **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular meetings to review progress against this plan.
