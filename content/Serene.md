### 9. Risks & Mitigation

|Risk|Description|Impact|Probability (High/Medium/Low)|Mitigation Strategy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|R001|API Mismatch|Frontend and backend struggle to integrate due to differing API expectations.|Medium|Early and frequent API contract discussions, shared documentation, mock APIs.|
|R002|Performance Bottlenecks|Application slow under load.|Medium|Regular performance testing, code profiling, database optimization.|
|R003|Scope Creep|Too many features added during development.|High|Strict adherence to initial scope, clear change management process.|
