# Six Essential Beliefs of Islam


## Allah
The one, merciful, infinite, compassionate, mighty, has no equal, is pure spirit.  The creator of and provider. Knows the past, present and future, but does not act to alter or change it. **Allah desired unconditional submission to his will, anything less equals eternal damnation**

## Angels  & Djinn
### Angels
Reasoning beings created by Allah, exist in a hierarchy. Each has specific duties. They are messengers and warriors of God. **Each person has 2 angels of lesser rank to record their good and evil deeds.**
### Djinna
Created halfway  between Angels/humans (can be good or bad). **They are led by Shayton (Satan - "To pull away from you")

## Holy Book
Meant to act as a guiding light - messengers recorded them to show their respective peoples the right path to God. [[Islam's Sacred Books|Qu'ran]] and [[Islam's Sacred Books|Hadith]]
### How sacred each is in order
1. Qur'an
2. Torah
3. Psalm
4. Gospel of Jesus
5. **Something like that**
## Prophets
They are messengers of God. **Muslims acknowledge 25 prophets. [[Islam Prophets|Muhammad]] is the last**

## Day of Judgement
At the end of the world, the body will be resurrected. Allah will judge you depending on your actions in your life.

## Predestination
The belief in an all-powerful force that rules the universe and knows all things leads one to believe that people have no choice in life.
Allah allows humanity to make choices in areas in which they will be judged.
