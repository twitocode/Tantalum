# The Law of Conservation of Energy #flashcard 
$$E_{i} = E_{f}$$
- **The total amount of energy in the universe is conserved**.
- There is a certain total amount of energy in the universe, and **this total never changes**.
- **New energy cannot be created** out of nothing; and **existing energy cannot disappear**.
- The energy that exists can only be changed from one form into another.
- When an energy transformation occurs, **no energy is lost**.
