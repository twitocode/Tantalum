## Course Information
- **Office Hours:**  

## Overview
- **Course Description:**  The mission of the course is to (1) introduce students to computational thinking (i.e., thinking that is inspired, supported, or enabled by computing) and (2) help students begin the process of developing a sophisticated understanding of computing. The students will achieve these goals by exploring the salient ideas, methods, and technologies in computing and by solving problems using functional programming
- **Learning Outcomes:**  
	1. Students should know and understand:  
	    1. What computational thinking is.  
	    2. The key ideas, methods, technologies, and areas of computing.  
	    3. Functional programming language concepts.  
	2. Students should be able to: 
		1. Design and write a simple functional program that satisfies a  
			simple requirements specification.  
		2. Formulate a test plan for a simple functional program.  
		3. Analyze a simple functional program.  
		4. Use Haskell as a problem-solving tool
