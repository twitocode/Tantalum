Computing is theg 

## Types of Thinking
**Mathematical Thinking**: 
Mathematics is a process for understanding the mathematical aspeconcts of the world we live in. Mathematical aspects include time, space, pattern, measure, logical consequence, etc.
- The process is based on **mathematical models** that consist of objects, facts, and concepts.
	- ex. Counting model, objects would be the natural numbers (1, ...), concepts are like every number has a successor, facts like counting backwards means that we have to stop at some point. 
		- you an study this model and expand on it and get a deeper understanding of what the model describes. 
			- ex. adding addition and subtraction
**Scientific Thinking**: 
Science is the systematic study of the world through observation an experiment
This thinking is centered on the *scientific method* - a process of hypothesis formation and experimentation. 

**Engineering Thinking**:
Engineering is the systematic and rational application of knowledge
- it serves society
- concerned with the *best practices* that will benefit society
- Understands problems and products in terms of *systems*
- Uses *requirements* to drive product development
- maintains public *safety and security.*

**Artistic Thinking**: 
**Art** is the production of artifacts that express beauty or salient aspects of the world and human existence. 

This type of thinking fosters the creation of art. 
concerned with finding inspiration through nature, past evenets, imagination, and other artwork
looks for new ideas
***Imposes restrictions to focus creativity***


## Now what is Computational Thinking?
Computational thinking includes all of these types of thinking

### What can and cannot we do with computing?
1. What are the *theoretical* limits of computing?
	- **yes, not every problem can be solved computationally** - very important 
2. What are the *practical* limits of computing?
