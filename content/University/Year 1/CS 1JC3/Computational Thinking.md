## Types of Thinking
**Mathematical Thinking**: 
Mathematics is a process for understanding the mathematical aspeconcts of the world we live in. Mathematical aspects include time, space, pattern, measure, logical consequence, etc.
- The process is based on **mathematical models** that consist of objects, facts, and concepts.
	- ex. Counting model, objects would be the natural numbers (1, ...), concepts are like every number has a successor, facts like counting backwards means that we have to stop at some point. 
		- you an study this model and expand on it and get a deeper understanding of what the model describes. 
			- ex. adding addition and subtraction
**Scientific Thinking**: 
Science is the systematic study of the world through observation an experiment
This thinking is centred on the *scientific method* - a process of hypothesis formation and experimentation. 


**Engineering Thinking**:
Engineering is the systematic and rational application of knowledge
- it serves society
- concerned with the *best practices* that will benefit society
- Understands problems and products in terms of *systems*
- Uses *requirements* to drive product development
- maintains public *safety and security.*

**Artistic Thinking**: 
**Art** is the production of artifacts that express beauty or salient aspects of the world and human existence. 

This type of thinking fosters the creation of art. 
concerned with finding inspiration through nature, past evenets, imagination, and other artwork
looks for new ideas
***Imposes restrictions to focus creativity***


## Now what is Computational Thinking?
Computational thinking includes all of these types of thinking


### What can and cannot we do with computing?
1. What are the *theoretical* limits of computing?
	- **yes, not every problem can be solved computationally** - very important 
2. What are the *practical* limits of computing?



## Gottfried Leibniz
- A german polymath 
	- can do multiple math things really well
- Developed calculus (1684) independently of Newton
	- His version was known as *infinitesimal calculus*. 
		- infinitesimals were numbers greater than 0 but smaller than any positive real number, we now use **limits** instead.
- A great computer scientist and engineer
	- **created the binary number system**
		- you can express any number with 0 and 1
	- Created a calculator called the Staffelwalze. 
		- He designed and it was the most advanced calculator at the time


 - Postulated *characteristica universalis* in which all scientific ideas could be expressed.
	 - ex - the sun will burn out in 1 year
 - Postulated *calculus ratiocinator* which was a computing device that could determine whether what you postulated with characteristicia unviersalis was true or false
	- **not theoretically possible**, but no one knew that until 1936 with *Alonzo Church and Alan Turing*
		- **They proved that there were undecidable decision problems** - meaning we cannot create a computer to solve the problem. Leibniz's dream was impossible
			-  **Decision Problems** are a computational problem that can be posed as a yes–no question on a set of input values
			- ex. *decidable* - take the set of all natural numbers, is a natural number prime or not?
			- ex. *undecidable* - **The Halting Problem**
				- **Church-Turing Thesis** was the belief that what is computable is precisely what a Turing machine (or lambda calculus) can compute

		- Heavily influenced by *Kurt Godel* with his first and second incompleteness theorems. 
			1. **First theorem**:  Any math system that’s powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic (like adding, multiplying, etc.) will always have some statements that are _true_ but can’t be proven within that system. *So, math is never “complete.”*
			2. **Second theorem**:  Such a system also can’t prove its own consistency (that it won’t lead to contradictions) from inside itself. *So, math can’t fully guarantee its own safety.*
