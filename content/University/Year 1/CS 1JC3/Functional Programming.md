## Haskell B Curry
American Mathematician
Developed **Combinatory Logic** which is a system for defining and using functions, you can define a function and use them without variables
- normally we would do this $f(x) = x^2$ but this function requires variables

**Curry-Howard Correspondence** was a way of merging logic and programming together so that proofs and programs are equivalent to each other.


**Curry Paradox** example
- if this sentence is true then Donald Trump is awesome
- $x \implies H \equiv x$
