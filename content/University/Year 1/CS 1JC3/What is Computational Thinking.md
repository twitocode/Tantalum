## Overview
- Topic:
- Main objectives:

## Notes
- morning vs night person
- alan turning and alonzo church figured out that current computation has some problems
	- They came out with problems that can not be solved - **a scientific fact**
		- Halting problem
- Wilhelm Leibniz and newton invented calculus - infitesimal calculus was the orignal name. They used infitesimalt to caluclate values. Now we use limits
	- the formula for the derivative was slightly different
	- infinitesmial - $0 < \epsilon < r$
		- for all real numbers $r > 0$
		- $st()$ is the standard part
- semantics vs syntax in computing
- semantics and syntax in real life
	- macid
		- semanticly it is ...
		- cant find information about people
		- public identifier
	- student number
		- a number that uniquely identifies you
		- hides your idnetiyy better
		- needed to find personal information about you
		- private identifier
 - Bifficus in the past
	 - Does addition have anything to do with counting?
	 - 7+6=13 calculato
	 - Using sets (x, x ,x , x ,x , x) and (x,x,x,x,x,x,). count 7 from the first set then continue with the second set to get 13.
	 - **Getting the answer is not enough, you need to understand how your got thant answer**
 - Cmomputation
	 - essence: taking hardware that allows you to manipulate data and wirting software that contorls how you manipulate the daata.
	 - **computers can store lots of stuff**
	 - universal computation now vs single computation from the past
	 - comptuers cand o things very very fast. (nano seconds)
	 - engineering, math, art and design is involved. 
- **develop software using the principles of engineering**
	- radical b/c in normal engineering things interact physically, not in softeng
- elegance can be signfiicant in cs. easy to produce and modifyable software
- not a pure form of art, it is mroe like architecture
## Key Terms
- Semantics:
- Syntax:

## Questions
- What is computing?
- What is computation thinking?
- What makes computational thinking different from other kinds of thinking?

## Summary
