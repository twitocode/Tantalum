## Notes
- cartesian product
	- (a, b) ordered pair, its a finite sequence called a tuple, in this case its a 2-tuple
		- tuples can have different types
		- lists have only 1 type
	- set of pairs A x B = {(a, b) | a <- A, b <- B}
		- a comes from A
		- b comes from B
- n-nary to u-nary, take inputs and make a tuple of it. n arguments -> tuple of n arguments
	- the other method is to use the curry function. 
		- first function takes an argument and returns a function that takes in the second argument.
