## Overview
- Topic:
- Main objectives:

## Notes
- cartesian product
	- (a, b) ordered pair, its a finite sequence called a tuple, in this case its a 2-tuple
		- tuples can have different types
		- lists have only 1 type
	- set of pairs A x B = {(a, b) | a <- A, b <- B}
		- a comes from A
		- b comes from B
- n-nary to u-nary, take inputs and make a tuple of it. n arguments -> tuple of n arguments
	- the other method is to use the curry function. 
		- first function takes an argument and returns a function that takes in the second argument.
- decision problems
	- making a binary decision
		- yes or no
	- there are some that cannot be solved by computers
	- turning and church showed that they do exist and gave examples
- bifficus of the future
	- focused on getting the answer instead of the understanding
	- We need a deep understanding of computing and we need to be learning everyday.
	- theres entrepeneurship 
		- hey this thing is good show it to manager, then manager say you should lead team in making it and show it to all department heads in the company.
