## Overview
- Topic:
- Main objectives:

## Notes
- cardinality
	- the size of a set A, written as $|A|$
	- bijection = total + injective + surjective
		- take a goat out of each pen and see which one has left, then that one is bigger with knowing how to count
	- We say $|A| = |B|$ if there is a bijection from A to B
	- A is infinite if there is some $A' A$ such that $|A'| = |A|$

	- there are multiple theorems
		- the cardinality of the set of all even nautral numbers = the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers
		- the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers = the cardinality of the set of all rational numbers
			- proved with a diagonalzation argument

		- the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers is less than the cardianlity of all real numbers
			- proved with a diagonalzation argument
