## Marking Scheme
- All missed work with a valid justification (for example, MSAF) will have its weight be reallocated to the final exam.
- The due dates are rough estimations, and you will be given at least two weeks to complete an assignment from the date it is posted.
- There will be a grace period of 5 days where you can submit late without penalty.

| Item | Weight | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assignment 0 (week 2) | 1% | Just to make sure you understand auto-grading |
| Assignment 1 (week 5) | 4% | Python basics: Booleans, strings, if statements |
| Assignment 2 (week 9) | 5% | Nested loops, nested lists |
| Midterm (Oct 29th) | 25% | Held during the evening. The lecture on Oct 28th will be a review session, there will be no lecture on Oct 29th. |
| Assignment 3 (week 12) | 5% | Recursion, file I/O, dictionaries |
| Exam (Exam week) | 45% | Cumulative |
| Test Floating | 10% | Better midterm or exam grade |
| Assignment Floating | 5% | Best assignment grade between Assignment 1, 2, and 3 |

## Academic Integrity
- **Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection:** Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student-submitted work. Students who do not wish their work to be submitted through the plagiarism detection software must inform the Instructor before the assignment is due. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to the plagiarism detection software.
- **Online Elements:** When you access the electronic components of a course, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. Continuation in a course that uses online elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure.
- **Online Proctoring:** Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lock/restrict their browser or other applications/software during tests or exams.
- **Conduct Expectations:** All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online. It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities remains in effect in virtual learning environments.
- **Copyright and Recording:** Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class.
