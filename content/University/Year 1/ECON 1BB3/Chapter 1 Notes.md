**Scarcity**: A situation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants.

**Economics**: The study of the choices people make in their efforts to make the best use of scarce resources in achieving their goals

**Economic models**:  simplifications of reality used to analyze real-world economic issues

# people are rational
Economists think that people are rational in a sense that they will make decisions and do actions that they *believe* will make them happy

People prefer benefits > cost. People dont do things to make them worse off

# people respond to incentive
ex. banks. our banks dont have crazy security like in the movies because the economic incentive for banks says that it is less costly to deal with the robberies than to have expensive armed security.

ex. dont have to pay for healthcare? i am less incentive to be healthy so then i could become obese easier

# optimal decisions are made at the margin
Economics is also known as *marginal science* because of how economists tend to think about decision. Some decisions are "all or nothing". Some decisions involve doing a little more or a little less

**Marginal**: extra or additional

Study or Netflix?
**Marginal Benefit**: watching another hour
**Marginal Cost:** lower grade from not studying

**Net Benefit**: benefit - cost
If you want a big net benefit then Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost
getting as much net benefit as possible means that MB = MC

a company maximizes their profits when their producing a product brings more revenue (MB) than costs (MC)
when revenue brought = cost brougt, then net benefit is maximized. this kind of thinking is called *marginal analysis*

**Marginal Analysis**: analysis that involved comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs

**Trade-offs**: doing more of one thing means that we have to do less of something else

**Opportunity cost**: the value of what we give up to engage in an activity. For something (like a good or service), it is the value of the next best alternative. 
- ex. opportunity cost of studying could be watching tv instead
- ex. I make $80k a year but i want to start a business, the opportunity cost of starting the business is the $80k i will lose out on (*does not matter if i make $80k in the business*)

> 3. Who will recieve the goods and services produced? 

## what goods and services will be produced?
Consumers, firms, and governments make these decisions and deal with scarcity by trading off one good or service for another. 

Each choice made comes with an opportunity cost, measured by the value of the best alternative given up.
## how will the good and services be produced?
Usually firms or governments make this decision
Producers of goods and services face a trade-off between using more workers and using more machine
- Firms have to decide whether to produce in Canada using few workers and many machines or produce in developing countries using many workers and fewer machines

## who will receive the good and services produced?
In Canada, it is dependant on how income is distributed. 
High income = ability to buy the most

Governments use taxes to help provide income to people in need. They also use taxes to supply goods and services that are not being provided in other ways.

# centrally planned economies vs market economies

**Centrally Planned Economy:** An economy in which the government decides how economic resources will be allocated (ex. Soviet Union
- not good at producing low cost (plentiful), high quality goods and services. 
	- the material standard of living for the average person was low.
- have all been dictatorships
	- always leads to collapse

**Market Economy**: An economy which relies on privately owned firms to produce goods and services and to decide how to produce them.

**Market**: all potential buyers and sellers of a good or service as well as the rules that determine how buyer and sellers interact
