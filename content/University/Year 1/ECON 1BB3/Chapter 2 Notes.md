Scarcity requires trade-offs. *factors of production* are scarce, which means that goods and services are scarce
- ex. time is scarce, there is a trade-off between spending time studying and spending time playing video games
**Factors of production**: the inputs used to make goods and services, such as workers, capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurial ability.


# Production Possibilities Frontier
**Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**: a curve showing the maximum attainable combination of two products that may be produced with available resources and technology. 

Example:
![[Pasted image 20250910205210.png]]

All the combinations on the frontier (such as A, B, C, D, and E) or inside it (such as point F) are attainable with the resources and tech that Tesla has

**Combinations on the frontier are (productively) efficient** because all available resources are being fully used, and the fewest possible resources are being used to produce a given amount of output

**Combinations inside the frontier, such as point F, are inefficient** because maximum output is not being obtained from the available resources.
- We can tell F is inefficient because Tesla could make 500 pickups at this factory and still make 300 sedans, instead of only making 100 pickups and 300 sedans. 
	- This would happen if workers were hired to do nothing

**Firms would like to be beyond the frontier**—at a point like G, where it would be producing 600 sedans and 500 pickups.
- *points outside the PPF are unattainable with the workers, equipment, materials, and technology currently in use*. To be able to produce 600 sedans and 500 pickups, **Tesla would require more resources.**


> [!Important] Content
> If Tesla is producing efficiently and is on the PPF, the only way to produce more of one type of vehicle is to produce fewer of another type

For Tesla, the opportunity cost of producing one more pickup is the number of sedans it will not be able to produce because it has shifted those resources to making pickups. 
- For example, in moving from point B to point C, the opportunity cost of producing 200 more pickups per day is the 200 fewer sedans that can be made.

**Allocative efficiency**: occurs when a society is making the combination of goods and services that are most valued by consumers, *therefore choosing the best point on the PPF*

# Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs
![[Pasted image 20250910210156.png]]
This is a curved PPF, not a 1:1 linear relationship. 

As the economy moves down the PPF, it experiences increasing marginal opportunity costs. Marginal opportunity costs increase because some workers, machines, and other resources are *better suited to some uses than to others.*

To move from point A to point B, the resources best suited to producing cars (and worst suited to performing operations) are shifted to car production.
*The result is a large gain in cars made while giving up few operations.*

 **Economists generally think that PPFs are bowed outward** (as in this example) rather than linear (as in the Tesla example earlier in the chapter).
 
## Diminishing Returns (not in textbook just my definition)
> [!error] Title
> The more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to that activity.

For example, the more hours you have already spent studying economics, the smaller the increase in your test grade from each additional hour you spend studying—and the greater the opportunity cost of using the hour in that way.

# Economic Growth
At any given time, the total resources available to an economy are fixed.
Produce more cars <=> Producing less Machines

**Over time the resources available to an economy may increase.** 
![[Pasted image 20250910211404.png]]
- Panel (a) shows that as more *economic resources become available and technological change occurs*, the economy can move from point A to point B, performing more operations and producing more cars. 
	- Increase Tech & Resources -> Increase Operations and Cars
- Panel (b) shows the results of technological change in the automobile industry that increases the quantity of cars workers can produce per year while leaving unchanged the maximum quantity of operations that can be performed. Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth.
	- Increase Tech -> Increase Cars and Keep Operations the same
		- **Making workers more efficient**

**Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth because they allow the economy to increase the production of goods and services, which raises the standard of living**

# Comparative Advantage and Trade
**Trade**: the act of buying and selling
- Markets are fundamentally about trade
- Directly - toys for games
- Indirectly - labour for money

I may not be able to pick apples and cherries as good as my neighbour, **but we both can still benefit from trading**.
