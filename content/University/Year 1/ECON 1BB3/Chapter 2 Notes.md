Scarcity requires trade-offs. *factors of production* are scarce, which means that goods and services are scarce
- ex. time is scarce, there is a trade-off between spending time studying and spending time playing video games
**Factors of production**: the inputs used to make goods and services, such as workers, capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurial ability.


# Production Possibilities Frontier
**Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**: a curve showing the maximum attainable combination of two products that may be produced with available resources and technology. 

Example:
![[Pasted image 20250910205210.png]]

All the combinations on the frontier (such as A, B, C, D, and E) or inside it (such as point F) are attainable with the resources and tech that Tesla has

**Combinations on the frontier are (productively) efficient** because all available resources are being fully used, and the fewest possible resources are being used to produce a given amount of output

**Combinations inside the frontier, such as point F, are inefficient** because maximum output is not being obtained from the available resources.
- We can tell F is inefficient because Tesla could make 500 pickups at this factory and still make 300 sedans, instead of only making 100 pickups and 300 sedans. 
	- This would happen if workers were hired to do nothing

**Firms would like to be beyond the frontier**—at a point like G, where it would be producing 600 sedans and 500 pickups.
- *points outside the PPF are unattainable with the workers, equipment, materials, and technology currently in use*. To be able to produce 600 sedans and 500 pickups, **Tesla would require more resources.**
- **trade can help a country consume beyond the PPF, but not PRODUCE beyond its PPF**


> [!Important] Content
> If Tesla is producing efficiently and is on the PPF, the only way to produce more of one type of vehicle is to produce fewer of another type

For Tesla, the opportunity cost of producing one more pickup is the number of sedans it will not be able to produce because it has shifted those resources to making pickups. 
- For example, in moving from point B to point C, the opportunity cost of producing 200 more pickups per day is the 200 fewer sedans that can be made.

**Allocative efficiency**: occurs when a society is making the combination of goods and services that are most valued by consumers, *therefore choosing the best point on the PPF*

# Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs
![[Pasted image 20250910210156.png]]
This is a curved PPF, not a 1:1 linear relationship. 

As the economy moves down the PPF, it experiences increasing marginal opportunity costs. Marginal opportunity costs increase because some workers, machines, and other resources are *better suited to some uses than to others.*

To move from point A to point B, the resources best suited to producing cars (and worst suited to performing operations) are shifted to car production.
*The result is a large gain in cars made while giving up few operations.*

 **Economists generally think that PPFs are bowed outward** (as in this example) rather than linear (as in the Tesla example earlier in the chapter).
 
## Diminishing Returns (not in textbook just my definition)
> [!error] Title
> The more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to that activity.

For example, the more hours you have already spent studying economics, the smaller the increase in your test grade from each additional hour you spend studying—and the greater the opportunity cost of using the hour in that way.

# Economic Growth
At any given time, the total resources available to an economy are fixed.
Produce more cars <=> Producing less Machines

**Over time the resources available to an economy may increase.** 
![[Pasted image 20250910211404.png]]
- Panel (a) shows that as more *economic resources become available and technological change occurs*, the economy can move from point A to point B, performing more operations and producing more cars. 
	- Increase Tech & Resources -> Increase Operations and Cars
- Panel (b) shows the results of technological change in the automobile industry that increases the quantity of cars workers can produce per year while leaving unchanged the maximum quantity of operations that can be performed. Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth.
	- Increase Tech -> Increase Cars and Keep Operations the same
		- **Making workers more efficient**

**Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth because they allow the economy to increase the production of goods and services, which raises the standard of living**

# Trade
**Trade**: the act of buying and selling
- Markets are fundamentally about trade
- Directly - toys for games
- Indirectly - labour for money

I may not be able to pick apples and cherries as good as my neighbour, **but we both can still benefit from trading**. 

![[Pasted image 20250910212228.png]]

1. Without Trade
	- You (Panel a):
		- Choose to produce and consume 8 kg apples + 12 kg cherries (Point A).
	- Neighbour (Panel b):	
		- Produces and consumes 9 kg apples + 42 kg cherries (Point C).

**Here, both of you are producing a mix of apples and cherries for yourselves.**

2. Specialization
	- If you specialize in apples, you can produce 20 kg apples.
	- If your neighbour specializes in cherries, she can produce 60 kg cherries.

**This maximizes total production by each focusing on what they are relatively better at producing.**

3. Trade Agreement
	- You trade 10 kg of apples to your neighbour.
	- In exchange, you receive 15 kg of cherries.

4. With Trade
	- You:
		- Start with 20 kg apples (from specialization).
		- After trading 10 away, you have 10 kg apples.
		- Receive 15 kg cherries in return → 10 kg apples + 15 kg cherries (Point B)
	- Neighbour:
		- Starts with 60 kg cherries (from specialization).
		- After trading 15 away, has 45 kg cherries left.
		- Gains 10 kg apples from you → 10 kg apples + 45 kg cherries (Point D).

5. Why Trade Helps
	- Before trade:
		- You: 8 apples + 12 cherries.
		- Neighbour: 9 apples + 42 cherries.
	- After trade:
		- You: 10 apples + 15 cherries (better off: more of both).
		- Neighbour: 10 apples + 45 cherries (better off: more of both).

Specialization and trade let both you and your neighbour consume outside your own PPFs (Points B and D), **meaning you both enjoy more apples and cherries than you could without trade.** This illustrates the classic economic principle that comparative advantage and trade create mutual gains.

# Comparative Advantage vs Absolute Advantage
**Absolute Advantage**: the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country *to produce more of a good or service than potential trading partners*, using the same amount of resources.
- In the example, the neighbour has an absolute advantage

> [!NOTE]
>  producing "more of a good or service... using the same amount of resources" is the same concept as producing the same amount of a good or service using fewer resources.

**Comparative Advantage**: the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce a good or service *at a lower opportunity cost than potential trading partners*. **It is the basis for trade**

Why do we both benefit?
- my PPF indicates that my opportunity cost of picking 1 kilogram of cherries is 1 kilogram of apples, vice versa.
- My neighbour's opportunity cost of **picking cherries is 0.5 kilogram of apples per kilogram of cherries**
	- If they were going the other way, shifting time from picking cherries to picking apples, **they would have to give up 2 kilograms of cherries in order to pick 1 kilogram of apples**
- Opportunity cost of picking apples is greater than picking cherries so the neighbour would rather make more cherries and trade for apples.
	- **The opportunity cost of picking apples is higher for my neighbour than for me**
	- **Even though they have an absolute advantage in picking both apples and cherries, you have a comparative advantage in picking apples**
		- *my neighbour still has the absolute and comparative advantage of picking cherries*

![[Pasted image 20250910213720.png]]

Determining whether a specific trade will lead to gains requires that we know the **exchange ratio**—in this case, the number of kilograms of cherries you would get for each kilogram of apples (or, more often, a price in terms of dollars)


> [!IMPORTANT] Title
> It is possible to have an absolute advantage in producing something without having a comparative advantage. This is the case with your neighbour and picking apples.
> 
> It is possible to have a comparative advantage without having an absolute advantage. In our example, you have the comparative advantage in picking apples, even though your neighbour can pick more than you.

# The Market System
There are physical markets like a grocery store, or virtual places like Amazon
In a market, the buyers are the people who demand goods or services (consumers), and the sellers are the people willing to provide them (suppliers).

**Product Markets**: markets for goods, such as computers, or services, such as haircuts.
- Households demand the good and services supplied by firms

**Factor Markets**: markets for the *factors of production (chapter 1)* and are divided into 4 categories:
	1.  Labour - all types of work
	2. Capital - physical capital (computers, machines, buildings, etc) that are used to make other goods
	3. Natural Resources - land, water, ore, etc, that are used in producing goods
	4. **Entrepreneurial Ability** - the ability to successfully produce and sell goods and services.

There are two groups of people that participate in markets:
- Households 
	- The owners and suppliers of factors of production, employed by firms to make goods and services. *Households use the income they receive from selling their factors of production to purchase the goods and services produced by firms.*
	- **Households also own all the other factors of production, either directly or indirectly, by owning the firms that have these resources. All firms are owned by households.**
- Firms are suppliers of goods and services. Firms use the funds they receive from selling goods and services to buy the factors of production needed to make the goods and services they sell.


## Circular-flow diagram
Used to see how participants in a market are linked. 

![[Pasted image 20250910215459.png]]
The blue arrow shows the flow of the factors of production.
The red arrows show the flow of goods and services from firms to households.
The green arrows shows the flow of funds.

# The gains from Free Markets
**Free Market**: exists when the government places few restrictions on how goods or services can be produced or sold, on who can buy or sell goods or services, or on how factors of production can be employed.
- doesnt really exist but canada comes close
- Countries that come closest to the free-market benchmark have much higher standards of living than those with centrally planned economies.

# The Legal Basis of a Successful Market System
Government must take active steps to provide a legal environment that will allow the market system to succeed.

## Protection of Private Property
For the market system to work well, individuals must be willing to take risks. Someone with $250 000 can be cautious and keep it safely in a bank—or even as cash. *But the market system won’t work unless a lot of people are willing to risk their savings by investing them in businesses.*

**Property Rights**: the rights individuals or firms have to the exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it. 


## Enforcement of Contracts and Property Rights
Business activity often involves someone agreeing to carry out some action in the future. 
- For example, you borrow $20 000 to buy a car and promise the bank—by signing a loan contract—that you will pay back the money (with interest) over the next five years.

For the market system to work, businesses and individuals have to rely on these contracts being honoured. If one party to a legal contract does not fulfill its obligations, the other party to the contract can take the other party to court to have the deal enforced.
