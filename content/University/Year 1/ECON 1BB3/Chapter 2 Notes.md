Scarcity requires trade-offs. *factors of production* are scarce, which means that goods and services are scarce
- ex. time is scarce, there is a trade-off between spending time studying and spending time playing video games
**Factors of production**: the inputs used to make goods and services, such as workers, capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurial ability.


# Production Possibilities Frontier
**Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**: a curve showing the maximum attainable combination of two products that may be produced with available resources and technology. 

Example:

All the combinations on the frontier (such as A, B, C, D, and E) or inside it (such as point F) are attainable with the resources and tech that Tesla has

**Combinations on the frontier are (productively) efficient** because all available resources are being fully used, and the fewest possible resources are being used to produce a given amount of output

**Combinations inside the frontier, such as point F, are inefficient** because maximum output is not being obtained from the available resources.
- We can tell F is inefficient because Tesla could make 500 pickups at this factory and still make 300 sedans, instead of only making 100 pickups and 300 sedans. 
	- This would happen if workers were hired to do nothing

**Firms would like to be beyond the frontier**â€”at a point like G, where it would be producing 600 sedans and 500 pickups.
- *points outside the PPF are unattainable with the workers, equipment, materials, and technology currently in use*. To be able to produce 600 sedans and 500 pickups, **Tesla would require more resources.**


> [!Important] Content
> If Tesla is producing efficiently and is on the PPF, the only way to produce more of one type of vehicle is to produce fewer of another type

For Tesla, the opportunity cost of producing one more pickup is the number of sedans it will not be able to produce because it has shifted those resources to making pickups. 
- For example, in moving from point B to point C, the opportunity cost of producing 200 more pickups per day is the 200 fewer sedans that can be made.

**Allocative efficiency**: occurs when a society is making the combination of goods and services that are most valued by consumers, *therefore choosing the best point on the PPF*

# Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs
![[Pasted image 20250910210156.png]]
This is a curved PPF, not a 1:1 linear relationship. 

As the economy moves down the PPF, it experiences increasing marginal opportunity costs. Marginal opportunity costs increase because some workers, machines, and other resources are *better suited to some uses than to others.*

To move from point A to point B, the resources best suited to producing cars (and worst suited to performing operations) are shifted to car production.
The result is a large gain in cars made while giving up few operations.
