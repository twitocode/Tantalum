**Perfectly Competitive Market:** A market that meets the conditions of (1) many buyers and sellers, (2) all firms selling identical products, and (3) no barriers to new firms entering the market.
- *These assumptions are very restrictive and only describe a very small number of real-world markets*, such as the global market for wheat or a few other agricultural products.

**Demand Schedules**: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price.

**Demand Curve**: A curve that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Market Demand**: The demand by all the consumers of a given good or service.
- ex: The market for a product, such as restaurant meals, that is purchased locally would include all the consumers in a city or a relatively small area

This example illustrates the *law of demand*
**Law of Demand**: The inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity o the product demanded, *assuming everything else is constant*
- is true for any *market demand curve*

# What Explains the Law of Demand?

## Substitution Effect
**Substitution Effect**: The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from a change in price making the good more or less expensive relative to other goods*, holding constant the effect of the price change on consumers’ purchasing power.
- tldr make thing cheap more people buy

## Income Effect
**Income Effect**: The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from the effect of a change in the good’s price on consumers’ purchasing power*.
- tldlr i got richer i can buy more


> [!NOTE] Title
> **Note that although we can analyze them separately, the substitution effect and the income effect happen simultaneously whenever a price changes.** Thus, a fall in the price of athletic shoes leads consumers to buy more athletic shoes, both because the athletic shoes are now less expensive relative to substitute products (such as casual shoes) and because the consumers in that household can afford to buy more of everything, including athletic shoes.

# That Magic Latin Phrase *Ceteris Paribus*
**Ceteris Paribus**: Meaning “all else equal,” *the requirement that when analyzing the relationship between two variables*—such as price and quantity demanded—*other variables must be held constant.*

A shift of a demand curve is _an increase or a decrease in demand_. **the curve could shift even if the prices don't change**

# Variables that Shift Market Demand
1. Income
2. Prices of Related Good
3. Tastes
4. Population and Demographics
5. Expectations

## Income
**Normal Good**: A good for which the demand increases as income rises and decreases as income falls.
