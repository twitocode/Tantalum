- *These assumptions are very restrictive and only describe a very small number of real-world markets*, such as the global market for wheat or a few other agricultural products.

**Demand Schedules**: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price.

**Demand Curve**: A curve that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Market Demand**: The demand by all the consumers of a given good or service.
