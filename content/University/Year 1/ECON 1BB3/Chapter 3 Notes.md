# Demand
**Perfectly Competitive Market:** A market that meets the conditions of (1) many buyers and sellers, (2) all firms selling identical products, and (3) no barriers to new firms entering the market.
- *These assumptions are very restrictive and only describe a very small number of real-world markets*, such as the global market for wheat or a few other agricultural products.

**Demand Schedules**: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price.

**Demand Curve**: A curve that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

**Market Demand**: The demand by all the consumers of a given good or service.
- ex: The market for a product, such as restaurant meals, that is purchased locally would include all the consumers in a city or a relatively small area

This example illustrates the *law of demand*
**Law of Demand**: The inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity o the product demanded, *assuming everything else is constant*
- is true for any *market demand curve*

# What Explains the Law of Demand?

## Substitution Effect
**Substitution Effect**: The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from a change in price making the good more or less expensive relative to other goods*, holding constant the effect of the price change on consumers’ purchasing power.
- tldr make thing cheap more people buy

## Income Effect
**Income Effect**: The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from the effect of a change in the good’s price on consumers’ purchasing power*.
- tldlr i got richer i can buy more


> [!NOTE] Title
> **Note that although we can analyze them separately, the substitution effect and the income effect happen simultaneously whenever a price changes.** Thus, a fall in the price of athletic shoes leads consumers to buy more athletic shoes, both because the athletic shoes are now less expensive relative to substitute products (such as casual shoes) and because the consumers in that household can afford to buy more of everything, including athletic shoes.

# That Magic Latin Phrase *Ceteris Paribus*
**Ceteris Paribus**: Meaning “all else equal,” *the requirement that when analyzing the relationship between two variables*—such as price and quantity demanded—*other variables must be held constant.*

![[Pasted image 20250912174321.png]]

A shift of a demand curve is _an increase or a decrease in demand_. **the curve could shift even if the prices don't change**

# Variables that Shift Market Demand
1. Income
2. Prices of Related Good
3. Tastes
4. Population and Demographics
5. Expectations

## Income
**Normal Good**: A good for which the demand increases as income rises and decreases as income falls.
- *most goods are this type*
- I can buy more athletic shoes.
**Inferior Good**: A good for which the demand increases as income falls and decreases as income rises.
- buy less poor people food when you get money

## Prices of Related Goods
**Substitutes**: Goods and services that can be used for the same purpos
- ex. such as athletic shoes and casual shoes
- Two goods are substitutes of one another if, when you buy more of one, you buy less of the other.
- A decrease in the price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the left. An increase in the price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right.
	- tldr - balenciaga becomes cheaper -> i buy less champions

**Compliments**: Goods and Services that are used together
- ex - hamburgers and buns
- When two goods are complements, the more consumers buy of one, the more they will buy of the other.
- A decrease in the price of a complement causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right. An increase in the price of a complement causes the demand curve to shift to the left.


## Tastes
Advertising shoe means customers are more likely to buy the product at any price, demand will shift right.
- an ad campaign affected consumers' *taste* for athletic shoes. 
**Taste is a catchall category that refers to the many subjective elements that can enter into a consumer’s decision to buy a product**

## Population and Demographcis
Population determines the total number of consumers who could demand a product.
- increase pops increase demand
	- demand curve shifts right
**Demographics**: the different types of people that make up a population
- young ppl, old ppl
- ex. Crumbl Cookies have a higher demand with young ppl more than old ppl

## Expectations
**Consumers choose not only which products to buy but also when to buy them.**
- ex. if enough consumers become convinced that houses will be selling for lower prices in three months:
	- the demand for houses will decrease now, as some consumers delay their purchases to wait for prices to fall.
**Consumers also change their purchasing habits when their expected income changes**
- ex. i start buying more now because i will get a promotion in 2 days

# Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded
![[Pasted image 20250912180531.png]]
## Demand
Happens when **other factors** (like income, preferences, or related goods) change, not the price. This is shown as a **shift of the entire demand curve**.
- ex - If incomes rise, the demand curve shifts rightward from **D₁ to D₂**, so at the same price of **$150**, demand increases from **8 million (point A)** to **10 million pairs (point C)**.
## Quantity Demanded
Happens when the **price** of the product changes. This is shown as a **movement along the same demand curve**.
- ex - When the price of shoes falls from **$150 to $125**, demand increases from **8 million (point A)** to **9 million pairs (point B)**.

# Supply

**Quantity Supplied**: The amount of a good or service that a firm is willing and able to supply at a given price, assuming all other variables are constant (*ceteris paribus*)
- when the price of a good rises, producing (and selling) that good is more profitable, and the quantity supplied will increase
- *As the marginal costs of making a product rise as output increases, a firm will supply more of that product only if the price is higher.*

**Supply Schedule**: a table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product supplied

**Supply curve**: shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product supplied

![[Pasted image 20250912181232.png]]

**Law of Supply**: states that, holding everything else constant, increases in price cause increases in the quantity supplied, and decreases in price result in decreases in the quantity supplied

> [!NOTE]
> - If only the price of the product changes, there is a movement along the supply curve, which is _an increase or a decrease in the quantity supplied_.
> - if any other variable that affects the willingness of firms to supply a good changes, the supply curve will shift, which is _an increase or a decrease in supply_

# Variables that Shift Market Supply
- Price of inputs
- Technological change
- Prices of substitutes in production    
- Number of firms in the market
- Expected future prices

## Price of Inputs
The factor most likely to cause the supply curve for a product to shift is a change in the price of an *input*
- increase price of input -> increase price of product, vice versa
**Input**: anything used in the making of a good or service. 
**Any time something like wages or interest rates (the price of labour and capital) change, the market supply curve will shift.**


## Technological Change
**Technological Change**: positive or negative change in the ability of a firm to produce a given level of output from a given quantity of inputs
- Positive technological change occurs when a firm is able to produce _more_ output with the same amount of inputs. 
	- This change will happen when the _productivity_ of workers or machines increases
- when positive technological change occurs, a firm will want to sell more of its product at every given price, making the market supply curve shift to the right

## Prices of Substitutes in Production
Firms often have to choose which goods they will produce at a particular time

- Example: Firms like Authentic Brands (Reebok/Tretorn) and Nike (Nike/Converse) make both athletic and casual shoes.
	- If the **price of casual shoes falls**, producing them becomes less profitable.    
	- Firms shift resources from casual shoes to athletic shoes.
	- This increases the **supply of athletic shoes**, shifting the **supply curve to the right**, even if the price of athletic shoes stays the same.


## Number of Firms in the Market
When new firms _enter_ a market, the supply curve shifts to the right, and when existing firms leave, or _exit_, a market, the supply curve shifts to the left

## Expected Future Prices
If a firm expects that the price of its product will be higher in the future than it is today, it has an incentive to decrease supply now and increase supply in the future

![[Pasted image 20250912182741.png]]

# Change in Supply vs Change in Quantity Supplied
- Change in quantity supplied:
    - Caused by a **change in the product’s price**.
    - Shown as a **movement along the supply curve**.
    - Example: If the price of athletic shoes rises from **$125 to $150**, supply increases from **11 million (point A)** to **12 million pairs (point B)**.
        
- Change in supply (just like change in demand):
    - Caused by a **factor other than price** (e.g., lower input costs, better technology).
    - Shown as a **shift of the supply curve**.
    - Example: A decrease in input costs shifts the curve from **S₁ to S₂**, so at the same price of **$150**, supply rises from **12 million (point B)** to **14 million pairs (point C)**.
