## Overview
- **Course Description:** An introduction to the method and theory of macroeconomics, and their application to the analysis of contemporary economic problems. The course is offered in a "blended" format with one 50-minute face-to-face session per week (on Tuesday), and the rest of the content delivered via online videos and textbook readings.
- **Meeting Details:** Each week you will use a "weekly schedule" to stay on task as you read the textbook, watch instructor videos, attend the weekly face-to-face session, and complete online homework. An asterisk (*) next to a video title in the weekly schedule means the content is not in the textbook.
