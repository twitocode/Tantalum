## Course Information
- **Office Hours**:   Tuesday Thursday 12:30 â€“ 1:30 or by appointment
- **Office**: HH420
- msaf does not really apply to this class because if i fail something, then it "doesnt count" whatever that means.
## Overview
- **Course Description:** This course is an introduction to linear algebra, covering both computational and theoretical approaches. Topics include vector spaces, linear independence, dimension, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization.
- **Course Objectives:** By the end of this course, you should be able to perform computations involving matrices (e.g., solving linear systems, finding determinants) and understand the theoretical concepts behind them.

## Resources
- **Textbook:** *Linear Algebra and its Applications* (6th Edition) by D. Lay, S. Lay, and J. McDonald. MyLab material is not required.
- **Online Resources:** The course will use YouTube, WebEx, Avenue-To-Learn, Microsoft Teams, MyMathlab, Crowdmark, and Childsmath.
- **Course Support:** Practice problems will be on Avenue to Learn. Tutorials are available, and there is a Math Drop-In Centre on the first floor of Hamilton Hall.
