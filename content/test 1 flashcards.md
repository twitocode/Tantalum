# What is Scarcity?
A situation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants.

# What is Economics?
The study of the choices people make in their efforts to make the best use of scarce resources in achieving their goals.

# What are Economic models?
Simplifications of reality used to analyze real-world economic issues.

# What do economists mean by "People are rational"?
Economists think that people are rational in a sense that they will make decisions and do actions that they *believe* will make them happy.
___
People prefer benefits > cost. People don't do things to make them worse off.

# Explain "People respond to incentive" with an example.
People respond to incentive.
Ex. banks. Our banks don't have crazy security like in the movies because the economic incentive for banks says that it is less costly to deal with the robberies than to have expensive armed security.
___
Ex. Don't have to pay for healthcare? I am less incentivized to be healthy so then I could become obese easier.

# What does it mean for optimal decisions to be made at the margin?
Economics is also known as *marginal science* because of how economists tend to think about decision. Some decisions are "all or nothing". Some decisions involve doing a little more or a little less.

# Define Marginal.
Extra or additional.

# What is Marginal Benefit?
The watching another hour (e.g., of Netflix).

# What is Marginal Cost?
The lower grade from not studying.

# How is Net Benefit calculated?
Benefit - Cost.
___
If you want a big net benefit then Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost.
Getting as much net benefit as possible means that MB = MC.

# What is Marginal Analysis?
Analysis that involves comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.

# What are Trade-offs?
Doing more of one thing means that we have to do less of something else.

# What is Opportunity cost?
The value of what we give up to engage in an activity. For something (like a good or service), it is the value of the next best alternative. (**IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE ALTERNATIVES, THEN THE HIGHEST VALUE IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST**)
- ex. opportunity cost of studying could be watching tv instead
- ex. I make $80k a year but i want to start a business, the opportunity cost of starting the business is the $80k i will lose out on (*does not matter if i make $80k in the business*)

# What are the three Fundamental Economic Questions?
1. What goods and services will be produced?
2. How will the goods and services be produced?
3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?

# How are decisions made about "What goods and services will be produced?"
Consumers, firms, and governments make these decisions and deal with scarcity by trading off one good or service for another.
___
Each choice made comes with an opportunity cost, measured by the value of the best alternative given up.

# How are decisions made about "How will the goods and services be produced?"
Usually firms or governments make this decision.
Producers of goods and services face a trade-off between using more workers and using more machines.
- Firms have to decide whether to produce in Canada using few workers and many machines or produce in developing countries using many workers and fewer machines.

# How are decisions made about "Who will receive the goods and services produced?"
In Canada, it is dependent on how income is distributed.
High income = ability to buy the most.
___
Governments use taxes to help provide income to people in need. They also use taxes to supply goods and services that are not being provided in other ways.

# What is a Centrally Planned Economy?
An economy in which the government decides how economic resources will be allocated (ex. Soviet Union).
- Not good at producing low cost (plentiful), high quality goods and services.
	- The material standard of living for the average person was low.
- **The incentive to work hard is not there compared to market economies.**
- Have all been dictatorships.
	- Always leads to collapse.

# What is a Market Economy?
An economy which relies on privately owned firms to produce goods and services and to decide how to produce them.
- **Market**: all potential buyers and sellers of a good or service as well as the rules that determine how buyer and sellers interact.
- Firms must produce what people want or else they go out of business.
- All trades must be agreed to by all the people involved.
- People's income is determined by what they have to sell (goods, labour, services).
- **Directly awards people's hard work.**
- **Decision making is shared by everyone in the market.**
- Luck is a large factor.

# What is a Mixed Economy?
An economy in which most economic decisions result from the **interaction of buyers and sellers in markets**, but in which **the government plays a significant role** in the allocation of resources.
- In Canada, most of the things you buy are produced by privately owned firms in response to the demands of consumers.
- Other goods and services are provided by the government, such as roads, national defence, and health care.

# What is Productive Efficiency?
Occurs when a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost.

# What is Allocative Efficiency?
Occurs when a country’s resources are used to produce the mix of goods and services that consumers want.

# What is Voluntary Exchange?
A situation that occurs in markets when both the buyer and seller of a product are made better off by the transaction.

# How do markets and competition promote efficiency?
Markets tend to be efficient because they rely on *voluntary exchange*. The voluntary nature of the exchange promotes competition that encourages producers to find cheaper ways to make good and services that they want to sell (customers want to pay less).
- Leads to productive efficiency - can't compete? go out of business.
	- Competition promotes allocative efficiency.
		- A firm that uses scarce resources to produce goods and services that consumers don’t want to buy goes out of business.

# What is Equity in economics?
The fair distribution of economic benefits.
___
Many people prefer equity because then governments can tax the richer to help provide for those who need the money; produces a more equal distribution of economic benefits.
- This may reduce efficiency.

# Compare efficiency and equity in different economic systems.
Market economies are more efficient while centrally planned economies are more equitable.
___
People have less incentive to open new businesses, to supply labour, and to save if the government takes a significant amount of the income they earn from working or saving.

# What are Economic models?
Simplified representations of reality used by economists to analyze complex real-world issues.
- They help in understanding interactions between different economic variables, such as prices, wages, and consumer behaviour.

# What are the steps to making an economic model?
1. Decide on the assumptions to use in developing the model.
2. Formulate a testable hypothesis.
3. Use economic data to test the hypothesis.
4. Revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well.
5. Retain the revised model to help answer similar economic questions in the future.

# Why must economic models be simple?
Economic models must be simple so we make assumptions.
Ex. Behavioural assumptions - motives of consumers and firms.
- Economists assume consumers will buy the goods and services that make them most happy.
- Assume firms will maximize profits.

# What is an Economic Variable?
Something measurable, like wages.

# What is a Hypothesis in economics?
A statement about an economic variable that may be either correct or incorrect (mainly a prediction).
- ex. favourable weather in Brazil will decrease the price of coffee in Canada.
- **They must be tested first.** To test a hypothesis, we analyze statistics on the relevant economic variables (ex. get data on coffee prices and other variables).
- Note that hypotheses must be statements that could, in fact, turn out to be incorrect. Statements such as “high coffee prices are bad” or “high wages for baristas are good” are value judgments rather than hypotheses because there is no way to disprove them.

# What is the Scientific Method in economics?
The process of developing models, testing hypothesis, and revising models.

# What is Positive analysis?
Concerns facts or logic (**economics is about this**).
- Looks at measurable effects—such as job losses, firms’ costs and profits, and wage gains for employed workers.

# What is Normative analysis?
About value judgements or what ought to be.
- Whether the policy is “good” or “bad.”

# What is Microeconomics?
The study of how individual economic agents make choices, how these choices come together to determine what happens in a single market, and the impact of government intervention on market outcomes.

# What is Macroeconomics?
The study of the economy as a whole, usually of a country, province, or region. Focuses on inflation, unemployment, and economic growth, policy issues, and government intervention to prevent recessions.

# What is Production?
The process of making goods and services.
- Often undertaken by **entrepreneurs**.

# Who is an Entrepreneur?
Someone who operates a business.
- Decides what to produce and how to produce it.
- Often invests their own money and takes on risk.
- About half of new businesses close within a few years.
- Essential for economic progress.

# What is the difference between Invention and Innovation?
**Invention**: Creation of a new good or process.
**Innovation**: Practical application of an invention or a major improvement.
- Example:
  - 1945: ENIAC computer (invention).
  - 1981: First personal computer (innovation).
  - 1990s: Widespread adoption and ongoing improvements.

# What is Technology in economics?
The processes a firm uses to turn inputs into outputs (goods/services).
- Depends on:
	- Managers’ skills
	- Workers’ education
	- Quality of equipment

# What are Firms (Company/Business)?
An organization that produces goods or services.
- Usually for profit, though some are non-profit (e.g., universities).
- Terms **firm**, **company**, and **business** are interchangeable.

# What are Goods?
Tangible items people want (e.g., books, computers, clothing).

# What are Services?
Activities done for others (e.g., haircuts, house cleaning, banking).

# What is Revenue?
Total money a firm receives from selling goods/services.
- Formula: $\text{Price per unit} * \text{Quantity sold}$

# What is Profit in economics?
The difference between a firm’s revenue and its costs.
- **Accounting profit**: Excludes some costs, only considers explicit costs.
- **Economic profit**: Includes all costs, including opportunity costs.
- In economics, *profit* usually means **economic profit**.
- ⚠️ Don’t confuse profit with revenue!

# What is a Household in economics?
Consists of all people making joint decisions in a home.
- Roles:
	- Supply factors of production (especially labour).
	- Consume goods and services produced in the economy.

# What are the Factors of Production (Economic Resources)?
Firms use these to produce goods and services:
- **Labour**
- **Capital**
- **Natural resources** (including land)
- **Entrepreneurial ability**
___
Households earn income by supplying these factors.

# What is Capital in economics?
- **Financial capital**: Stocks, bonds, bank accounts, money.
- **Physical capital** (the usual meaning in economics): Manufactured goods used to make other goods (e.g., computers, factories, tools, trucks).
- **Capital stock**: Total physical capital in a country.

# What is Human Capital?
Training, skills, and knowledge accumulated by individuals.
- Example: University graduates generally have higher human capital than high school graduates.

# Chapter 3 Notes

# What is a Perfectly Competitive Market?
A market that meets the conditions of (1) many buyers and sellers, (2) all firms selling identical products, and (3) no barriers to new firms entering the market.
- *These assumptions are very restrictive and only describe a very small number of real-world markets*, such as the global market for wheat or a few other agricultural products.

# What are Demand Schedules?
A table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

# What is Quantity Demanded?
The amount of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price.

# What is a Demand Curve?
A curve that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.

# What is Market Demand?
The demand by all the consumers of a given good or service.
- ex: The market for a product, such as restaurant meals, that is purchased locally would include all the consumers in a city or a relatively small area.
![[Pasted image 20250912173423.png]]

# What is the Law of Demand?
The inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded, *assuming everything else is constant*.
- Is true for any *market demand curve*.

# What is the Substitution Effect?
The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from a change in price making the good more or less expensive relative to other goods*, holding constant the effect of the price change on consumers’ purchasing power.
- tldr make thing cheap more people buy.

# What is the Income Effect?
The change in the quantity demanded of a good that results *from the effect of a change in the good’s price on consumers’ purchasing power*.
- tldlr i got richer i can buy more.

# Do the Substitution and Income Effects happen separately?
No, although we can analyze them separately, the substitution effect and the income effect happen simultaneously whenever a price changes. Thus, a fall in the price of athletic shoes leads consumers to buy more athletic shoes, both because the athletic shoes are now less expensive relative to substitute products (such as casual shoes) and because the consumers in that household can afford to buy more of everything, including athletic shoes.

# What does *Ceteris Paribus* mean?
Meaning “all else equal,” *the requirement that when analyzing the relationship between two variables*—such as price and quantity demanded—*other variables must be held constant.*
![[Pasted image 20250912174321.png]]
A shift of a demand curve is _an increase or a decrease in demand_. **The curve could shift even if the prices don't change.**

# What are the five variables that shift Market Demand?
1. Income
2. Prices of Related Good
3. Tastes
4. Population and Demographics
5. Expectations

# What is a Normal Good?
A good for which the demand increases as income rises and decreases as income falls.
- *Most goods are this type*.
- Ex: I can buy more athletic shoes.

# What is an Inferior Good?
A good for which the demand increases as income falls and decreases as income rises.
- Ex: Buy less poor people food when you get money.

# What are Substitutes in economics?
Goods and services that can be used for the same purpose.
- Ex. such as athletic shoes and casual shoes.
- Two goods are substitutes of one another if, when you buy more of one, you buy less of the other.
- A decrease in the price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the left. An increase in the price of a substitute causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right.
	- tldr - Balenciaga becomes cheaper -> I buy less Champions.

# What are Compliments in economics?
Goods and Services that are used together.
- Ex - hamburgers and buns.
- When two goods are complements, the more consumers buy of one, the more they will buy of the other.
- A decrease in the price of a complement causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right. An increase in the price of a complement causes the demand curve to shift to the left.

# How do Tastes affect market demand?
Advertising a product means customers are more likely to buy it at any price, so demand will shift right.
- An ad campaign affected consumers' *taste* for athletic shoes.
**Taste is a catchall category that refers to the many subjective elements that can enter into a consumer’s decision to buy a product.**

# How do Population and Demographics affect market demand?
Population determines the total number of consumers who could demand a product.
- Increase in population increases demand.
	- Demand curve shifts right.
**Demographics**: the different types of people that make up a population.
- Young people, old people.
- Ex. Crumbl Cookies have a higher demand with young people more than old people.

# How do Expectations affect market demand?
**Consumers choose not only which products to buy but also when to buy them.**
- Ex. if enough consumers become convinced that houses will be selling for lower prices in three months:
	- The demand for houses will decrease now, as some consumers delay their purchases to wait for prices to fall.
**Consumers also change their purchasing habits when their expected income changes.**
- Ex. I start buying more now because I will get a promotion in 2 days.
![[Pasted image 20250912175600.png]]

# What is the difference between a Change in Demand and a Change in Quantity Demanded?
**Change in Demand**: Happens when **other factors** (like income, preferences, or related goods) change, not the price. This is shown as a **shift of the entire demand curve**.
- Ex - If incomes rise, the demand curve shifts rightward from **D₁ to D₂**, so at the same price of **$150**, demand increases from **8 million (point A)** to **10 million pairs (point C)**.
___
**Change in Quantity Demanded**: Happens when the **price** of the product changes. This is shown as a **movement along the same demand curve**.
- Ex - When the price of shoes falls from **$150 to $125**, demand increases from **8 million (point A)** to **9 million pairs (point B)**.
![[Pasted image 20250912180531.png]]

# What is Quantity Supplied?
The amount of a good or service that a firm is willing and able to supply at a given price, assuming all other variables are constant (*ceteris paribus*).
- When the price of a good rises, producing (and selling) that good is more profitable, and the quantity supplied will increase.
- *As the marginal costs of making a product rise as output increases, a firm will supply more of that product only if the price is higher.*

# What is a Supply Schedule?
A table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product supplied.

# What is a Supply curve?
Shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product supplied.
![[Pasted image 20250912181232.png]]

# What is the Law of Supply?
States that, holding everything else constant, increases in price cause increases in the quantity supplied, and decreases in price result in decreases in the quantity supplied.
![[Pasted image 20250912181406.png]]

# What are the five variables that shift Market Supply?
- Price of inputs
- Technological change
- Prices of substitutes in production
- Number of firms in the market
- Expected future prices

# How does the Price of Inputs affect market supply?
The factor most likely to cause the supply curve for a product to shift is a change in the price of an *input*.
- Increase price of input -> increase price of product, vice versa.
**Input**: anything used in the making of a good or service.
**Any time something like wages or interest rates (the price of labour and capital) change, the market supply curve will shift.**

# What is Technological Change in supply?
Positive or negative change in the ability of a firm to produce a given level of output from a given quantity of inputs.
- Positive technological change occurs when a firm is able to produce _more_ output with the same amount of inputs.
	- This change will happen when the _productivity_ of workers or machines increases.
- When positive technological change occurs, a firm will want to sell more of its product at every given price, making the market supply curve shift to the right.

# How do Prices of Substitutes in Production affect market supply?
Firms often have to choose which goods they will produce at a particular time.
- Example: Firms like Authentic Brands (Reebok/Tretorn) and Nike (Nike/Converse) make both athletic and casual shoes.
	- If the **price of casual shoes falls**, producing them becomes less profitable.
	- Firms shift resources from casual shoes to athletic shoes.
	- This increases the **supply of athletic shoes**, shifting the **supply curve to the right**, even if the price of athletic shoes stays the same.

# How does the Number of Firms in the Market affect market supply?
When new firms _enter_ a market, the supply curve shifts to the right, and when existing firms leave, or _exit_, a market, the supply curve shifts to the left.

# How do Expected Future Prices affect market supply?
If a firm expects that the price of its product will be higher in the future than it is today, it has an incentive to decrease supply now and increase supply in the future.
![[Pasted image 20250912182741.png]]

# What is the difference between a Change in Supply and a Change in Quantity Supplied?
**Change in quantity supplied**:
    - Caused by a **change in the product’s price**.
    - Shown as a **movement along the supply curve**.
    - Example: If the price of athletic shoes rises from **$125 to $150**, supply increases from **11 million (point A)** to **12 million pairs (point B)**.
___
**Change in supply**:
    - Caused by a **factor other than price** (e.g., lower input costs, better technology).
    - Shown as a **shift of the supply curve**.
    - Example: A decrease in input costs shifts the curve from **S₁ to S₂**, so at the same price of **$150**, supply rises from **12 million (point B)** to **14 million pairs (point C)**.
![[Pasted image 20250912183153.png]]

# What is Market Equilibrium?
A situation in which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
- Only at this point is the quantity of athletic shoes consumers are willing to buy equal to the quantity of athletic shoes firms are willing to sell.
- In this case, the _equilibrium price_ is $100 and the _equilibrium quantity_ is 10 million pairs per week.

# What is Competitive Market Equilibrium?
A market equilibrium with many buyers and sellers.

# How do markets eliminate Surpluses and Shortages to reach Equilibrium?
A market that is not in equilibrium moves toward equilibrium.
___
**Surplus**: When the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded.
- A surplus means that firms will be unable to sell all the goods they would like and the goods they’re producing will start piling up.
	- Translates into an excess of quantity supplied over quantity demanded.
		- **ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE MARKET PRICE IS ABOVE THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICE.**
- *Easiest way to get rid of it is to put goods on sale.*
___
**Shortage**: When the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied.
- When a shortage occurs, some consumers will be unable to buy athletic shoes at the current price. When this happens, firms will realize they can raise the price without losing sales.
	- A higher price means a decrease in the quantity demanded and an increase in the quantity supplied. The increase in price will reduce the size of the shortage, *but as long as the price remains below the equilibrium price of $100, there will be a shortage and firms will have an incentive to increase the prices they charge. Only when the price has risen to $100 will the market be in equilibrium.*

# What is the effect of a shift in Supply on Equilibrium?
![[Pasted image 20250912183923.png]]

# What is the effect of a shift in Demand on Equilibrium?
![[Pasted image 20250912184029.png]]

# How do shifts in Demand and Supply affect Equilibrium over time?
In many markets, the demand curve shifts to the right over time as populations and incomes grow.
The supply often shifts to the right over time too, as new firms enter the market or technology improves.
___
**Whether the equilibrium price rises or falls over time depends on which shift is bigger**.
- If the *shift in the demand curve is bigger* than the shift in the supply curve, **the price will rise.**
- If the *shift in the supply curve is bigger* than the shift in the demand curve, **the price will fall.**
![[Pasted image 20250912184221.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250912184300.png]]

# What is an important point to remember about shifts in curves versus movements along a curve?
When analyzing markets using demand and supply curves, it is important to remember that _when a shift in a demand or supply curve causes a change in equilibrium price, the change in price does not cause a further shift in demand or supply_.

# Chapter 2 Notes

# Why does scarcity require trade-offs?
*Factors of production* are scarce, which means that goods and services are scarce.
- Ex. time is scarce, there is a trade-off between spending time studying and spending time playing video games.

# What are Factors of production?
The inputs used to make goods and services, such as workers, capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurial ability.

# What is a Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)?
A curve showing the maximum attainable combination of two products that may be produced with available resources and technology.
![[Pasted image 20250910205210.png]]

# What do points on, inside, and outside the PPF represent?
- **Combinations on the frontier (e.g., A, B, C, D, E) are (productively) efficient** because all available resources are being fully used, and the fewest possible resources are being used to produce a given amount of output.
- **Combinations inside the frontier (e.g., F) are inefficient** because maximum output is not being obtained from the available resources.
	- Ex: Tesla could make 500 pickups and 300 sedans, instead of 100 pickups and 300 sedans at point F.
- **Points outside the PPF (e.g., G) are unattainable** with the workers, equipment, materials, and technology currently in use. To reach these points, **Tesla would require more resources.**
___
If Tesla is producing efficiently and is on the PPF, the only way to produce more of one type of vehicle is to produce fewer of another type.

# What is Allocative efficiency?
Occurs when a society is making the combination of goods and services that are most valued by consumers, *therefore choosing the best point on the PPF*.

# Why are PPFs generally bowed outward, indicating increasing marginal opportunity costs?
As the economy moves down the PPF, it experiences increasing marginal opportunity costs. Marginal opportunity costs increase because some workers, machines, and other resources are *better suited to some uses than to others.*
___
To move from point A to point B (on a curved PPF), the resources best suited to producing cars (and worst suited to performing operations) are shifted to car production.
*The result is a large gain in cars made while giving up few operations.*
___
**Economists generally think that PPFs are bowed outward** (as in this example) rather than linear (as in the Tesla example earlier in the chapter).
![[Pasted image 20250910210156.png]]

# What is Diminishing Returns?
The more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to that activity.
___
For example, the more hours you have already spent studying economics, the smaller the increase in your test grade from each additional hour you spend studying—and the greater the opportunity cost of using the hour in that way.

# How does Economic Growth affect the PPF?
**Over time the resources available to an economy may increase.**
- Panel (a) shows that as more *economic resources become available and technological change occurs*, the economy can move from point A to point B, performing more operations and producing more cars.
	- Increase Tech & Resources -> Increase Operations and Cars.
- Panel (b) shows the results of technological change in the automobile industry that increases the quantity of cars workers can produce per year while leaving unchanged the maximum quantity of operations that can be performed. Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth.
	- Increase Tech -> Increase Cars and Keep Operations the same.
		- **Making workers more efficient.**
___
**Shifts in the PPF represent economic growth because they allow the economy to increase the production of goods and services, which raises the standard of living.**
![[Pasted image 20250910211404.png]]

# What is Trade?
The act of buying and selling.
- Markets are fundamentally about trade.
- Directly - toys for games.
- Indirectly - labour for money.
![[Pasted image 20250910212055.png]]

# Explain how specialization and trade can benefit individuals.
1. Without Trade
	- You (Panel a): Choose to produce and consume 8 kg apples + 12 kg cherries (Point A).
	- Neighbour (Panel b): Produces and consumes 9 kg apples + 42 kg cherries (Point C).
___
2. Specialization
	- If you specialize in apples, you can produce 20 kg apples.
	- If your neighbour specializes in cherries, she can produce 60 kg cherries.
___
3. Trade Agreement
	- You trade 10 kg of apples to your neighbour.
	- In exchange, you receive 15 kg of cherries.
___
4. With Trade
	- You: Start with 20 kg apples (from specialization). After trading 10 away, you have 10 kg apples. Receive 15 kg cherries in return → 10 kg apples + 15 kg cherries (Point B).
	- Neighbour: Starts with 60 kg cherries (from specialization). After trading 15 away, has 45 kg cherries left. Gains 10 kg apples from you → 10 kg apples + 45 kg cherries (Point D).
___
5. Why Trade Helps
	- Before trade: You: 8 apples + 12 cherries. Neighbour: 9 apples + 42 cherries.
	- After trade: You: 10 apples + 15 cherries (better off: more of both). Neighbour: 10 apples + 45 cherries (better off: more of both).
___
Specialization and trade let both you and your neighbour consume outside your own PPFs (Points B and D), **meaning you both enjoy more apples and cherries than you could without trade.** This illustrates the classic economic principle that comparative advantage and trade create mutual gains.
![[Pasted image 20250910212228.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250910213003.png]]

# What is Absolute Advantage?
The ability of an individual, a firm, or a country *to produce more of a good or service than potential trading partners*, using the same amount of resources.
- Ex: In the example, the neighbour has an absolute advantage in picking both apples and cherries.
___
Producing "more of a good or service... using the same amount of resources" is the same concept as producing the same amount of a good or service using fewer resources.

# What is Comparative Advantage?
The ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce a good or service *at a lower opportunity cost than potential trading partners*. **It is the basis for trade.**
![[Pasted image 20250910213720.png]]

# Can someone have an absolute advantage without a comparative advantage, and vice versa?
Yes.
- It is possible to have an absolute advantage in producing something without having a comparative advantage. This is the case with your neighbour and picking apples.
- It is possible to have a comparative advantage without having an absolute advantage. In our example, you have the comparative advantage in picking apples, even though your neighbour can pick more than you.

# What are Product Markets?
Markets for goods, such as computers, or services, such as haircuts.
- Households demand the good and services supplied by firms.

# What are Factor Markets?
Markets for the *factors of production (chapter 1)* and are divided into 4 categories:
1. Labour - all types of work
2. Capital - physical capital (computers, machines, buildings, etc) that are used to make other goods
3. Natural Resources - land, water, ore, etc, that are used in producing goods
4. **Entrepreneurial Ability** - the ability to successfully produce and sell goods and services.

# What are the roles of Households and Firms in the market system?
- **Households**: The owners and suppliers of factors of production, employed by firms to make goods and services. *Households use the income they receive from selling their factors of production to purchase the goods and services produced by firms.*
	- **Households also own all the other factors of production, either directly or indirectly, by owning the firms that have these resources. All firms are owned by households.**
- **Firms**: Suppliers of goods and services. Firms use the funds they receive from selling goods and services to buy the factors of production needed to make the goods and services they sell.

# What is a Circular-flow diagram?

For the market system to work, businesses and individuals have to rely on these contracts being honoured. If one party to a legal contract does not fulfill its obligations, the other party to the contract can take the other party to court to have the deal enforced.
