# What is Scarcity?
A situation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants.


# What is Economics?
The study of the choices people make in their efforts to make the best use of scarce resources in achieving their goals.


# What are economic models?
Simplifications of reality used to analyze real-world economic issues.


# In economics, what does it mean for people to be "rational"?
Economists assume people are rational in the sense that they will make decisions and take actions that they _believe_ will make them happy, preferring benefits over costs.


# How do people respond to incentives?
People's actions and decisions change based on incentives. For example, if the cost of something (like bank robbery) is low relative to the benefit, it might happen more often.


# Why is economics sometimes called the "marginal science"?
Because economists often analyze decisions by thinking about the "marginal" (extra or additional) benefits and costs of doing a little more or a little less of an activity.


# What is Marginal Analysis?
Analysis that involves comparing marginal benefits (MB) and marginal costs (MC).


# When is the Net Benefit of an activity maximized?
The Net Benefit (Benefit - Cost) is maximized when the Marginal Benefit equals the Marginal Cost (MB = MC).


# What are Trade-offs?
The idea that doing more of one thing means we have to do less of something else due to scarcity.


# What is Opportunity Cost?
The value of the next best alternative given up to engage in an activity. If there are multiple alternatives, it is the value of the **highest-valued** alternative.


# What are the three fundamental economic questions?
1. What goods and services will be produced?
2. How will the goods and services be produced?
3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?
    


# What is a Centrally Planned Economy?
An economy in which the government decides how economic resources will be allocated. They tend to be poor at producing low-cost, high-quality goods and have weak incentives for hard work.


# What is a Market Economy?
An economy that relies on privately owned firms to produce goods and services. Decision-making is shared by all participants, and hard work is directly rewarded.


# What is a Mixed Economy?
An economy where most decisions result from the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets, but the government also plays a significant role in allocating resources (e.g., Canada).


# What is Productive Efficiency?
When a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost.


# What is Allocative Efficiency?
When a country’s resources are used to produce the mix of goods and services that consumers want.


# What is a Voluntary Exchange?
A market situation where both the buyer and the seller of a product are made better off by the transaction. It promotes both productive and allocative efficiency.


# What is Equity in economics?
The fair distribution of economic benefits.


# What is the primary trade-off between efficiency and equity?
Policies that promote equity (like high taxes on the wealthy) can reduce efficiency by decreasing the incentive to work, save, and open new businesses. Market economies tend to be more efficient, while centrally planned economies aim for more equity.


# What is the difference between Positive and Normative analysis?
**Positive analysis** concerns facts or logic (what _is_).
**Normative analysis** is about value judgments (what _ought to be_).


# What is Microeconomics?
The study of how individual economic agents (households, firms) make choices, their interaction in single markets, and the impact of government intervention on those markets.


# What is Macroeconomics?
The study of the economy as a whole, focusing on issues like inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.


# What is the difference between an Invention and an Innovation?

An **invention** is the creation of a new good or process.
An **innovation** is the practical application of an invention or a significant improvement to an existing product/process.


# What is Technology in an economic context?
The processes a firm uses to turn inputs into outputs (goods/services). It depends on managerial skill, worker education, and equipment quality.


# What is the difference between Revenue and Profit?
**Revenue** is the total money a firm receives from sales (Price×Quantity).
**Profit** is the difference between a firm’s revenue and its costs (Revenue−Costs). In economics, this usually refers to _economic profit_, which includes opportunity costs.


# What are the four Factors of Production (Economic Resources)?
1. Labour
2. Capital (Physical)
3. Natural Resources
4. Entrepreneurial Ability
    


# What is the difference between Financial Capital and Physical Capital?
**Financial capital** includes stocks, bonds, and money.
**Physical capital** (the usual meaning in economics) refers to manufactured goods used to produce other goods, like factories, tools, and computers.


# What is Human Capital?
The accumulated training, skills, and knowledge of a worker.


# What is a Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)?
A curve showing the maximum attainable combinations of two products that can be produced with available resources and technology.


# What do points on, inside, and outside the PPF represent?
- **On the PPF**: Efficient production.
- **Inside the PPF**: Inefficient production.
- **Outside the PPF**: Unattainable production with current resources.
    


# How does the PPF illustrate opportunity cost?
It shows that to produce more of one good (moving along the curve), you must produce less of another. The amount of the other good you give up is the opportunity cost.


# What are Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs?
This principle states that the more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff from devoting additional resources. It's why the PPF is typically bowed outward.


# What does Economic Growth look like on a PPF?
An outward shift of the entire PPF, allowing the economy to produce more of both goods. This is caused by an increase in resources or technological advancement.


# What is Absolute Advantage?
The ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce more of a good or service than competitors using the same amount of resources.


# What is Comparative Advantage?
The ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a good or service at a **lower opportunity cost** than competitors. This is the basis for trade.


# Can you have a comparative advantage without an absolute advantage?
Yes. Trade is mutually beneficial even if one party has an absolute advantage in producing both goods, as long as each party has a comparative advantage in producing one of the goods.


# What is the difference between Product Markets and Factor Markets?
**Product Markets** are for goods (computers) and services (haircuts).
**Factor Markets** are for the factors of production (labour, capital, etc.).


# What role do Households and Firms play in the circular-flow diagram?
**Households** supply factors of production (like labour) to firms and demand goods and services from firms.
**Firms** demand factors of production from households and supply goods and services to households.


# What is a Free Market?
A market with few government restrictions on how goods can be produced or sold, or how factors of production can be employed.


# What are Property Rights?
The rights individuals or firms have to the exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it. They are essential for a successful market system.


# What defines a Perfectly Competitive Market?
1. Many buyers and sellers.
2. All firms sell identical products.
3. No barriers for new firms to enter the market.
    


# What is the Law of Demand?
The rule that, holding everything else constant (_ceteris paribus_), when the price of a product falls, the quantity demanded will increase, and when the price rises, the quantity demanded will decrease.


# What is the difference between the Substitution Effect and the Income Effect?
**Substitution Effect**: A price change makes a good relatively more or less expensive compared to other goods, causing a change in quantity demanded.
**Income Effect**: A price change affects a consumer's purchasing power, causing a change in quantity demanded.


# What are the 5 variables that can shift the market demand curve?
1. Income
2. Prices of Related Goods
3. Tastes
4. Population and Demographics
5. Expectations
    

# What is the difference between a Normal Good and an Inferior Good?
A **Normal Good** is a good for which demand increases as income rises.
An **Inferior Good** is a good for which demand increases as income falls.


# What is the difference between Substitutes and Complements?
**Substitutes** are goods used for the same purpose. An increase in the price of one leads to an increase in demand for the other.
**Complements** are goods used together. An increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in demand for the other.


# What is the difference between a "change in demand" and a "change in quantity demanded"?
A **change in quantity demanded** is a movement _along_ the demand curve caused by a change in the product's price.
A **change in demand** is a _shift_ of the entire demand curve caused by a change in a non-price factor (e.g., income, tastes).


# What is the Law of Supply?
The rule that, holding everything else constant, an increase in price causes an increase in the quantity supplied, and a decrease in price causes a decrease in the quantity supplied.


# What are the 5 variables that can shift the market supply curve?
1. Price of inputs
2. Technological change
3. Prices of substitutes in production
4. Number of firms in the market
5. Expected future prices
    

# What is the difference between a "change in supply" and a "change in quantity supplied"?
A **change in quantity supplied** is a movement _along_ the supply curve caused by a change in the product's price.
A **change in supply** is a _shift_ of the entire supply curve caused by a change in a non-price factor (e.g., input prices, technology).


# What is Market Equilibrium?
A situation in which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. The price at which this occurs is the equilibrium price.


# What is a Surplus and how does the market correct it?
A surplus occurs when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, which happens when the market price is **above** equilibrium. Firms will lower prices to sell the excess goods, moving the market back toward equilibrium.


# What is a Shortage and how does the market correct it?
A shortage occurs when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied, which happens when the market price is **below** equilibrium. Firms will raise prices due to high demand, moving the market back toward equilibrium.


# What happens to equilibrium price and quantity if demand increases (shifts right)?
Both equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity will rise.


# What happens to equilibrium price and quantity if supply increases (shifts right)?
The equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity will rise.


# If both demand and supply increase, what is the effect on equilibrium price and quantity?
The equilibrium **quantity will definitely increase**. The effect on equilibrium **price is ambiguous** and depends on whether the shift in demand is larger or smaller than the shift in supply.
